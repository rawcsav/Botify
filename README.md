# Botify - Personalized Spotify Playlist Analyzer and Recommender

This is my personal research project where I have analyzed my Spotify playlist and explored genres to generate recommendations. The project incorporates advanced techniques including statistical engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web scraping.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Botify - Playlist Splitting**: Analyzing my Spotify playlist and finding the best way to split it into smaller playlists, considering numerous factors.
2. **Botify Grime - Genre Exploration and Recommendations**: Investigating various genres within the music catalog, identifying the most relevant genres for my taste, and generating new playlist recommendations based on these genres.
