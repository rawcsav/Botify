When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
View from a balcony, pool lit up blue
Lawn chairs next to the ice chest
Stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
Now I'm getting blown by a bitch
Who? I don't know her name
Gold chain hanging, got a few in the room
But I don't wear them out, only wear them in the house
'Cause I shine so bright, I don't wanna blind you
Who knew Yung $now wouldn't melt in the summer? It's true
Cold as a polar bear
Chilling with Stunna and $lick, I'm surrounded by tulips
Got me 'bout two clips
Got me 'bout two scripts filled up with Oxy
Smoke hovers all around my fucking body
I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah, I shot him
$lick got the shovels, and we digging all night
Pouya in the Caddy
Told him, ""shine the light bright"" 'cause I'm digging in darkness
What was a good day has turned into the usual
Back in all black like a funeral

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
Runnin' from the cops through the motherfucking 7th
Six bodies dropped, and nobody went to heaven
Block stay hot when I'm creeping with the weapon
Gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
City of the crescent, riding with a Smith and Wesson
Got a motherfucker guessing when I hit 'em with the blessing
Two shots to the dome, six shots in the chrome
All shot through your home, now that's a crime zone
$-U-I-C-I-D-E, $carecrow creepin' with Uzi
Lucifer, please come save me, throw crucifixes at my feet
Walking through the depths of hell, watchin' as the oceans swell

Nothing but death in every cell

Yuh, she too deep in the flask
Drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
Déjà vu, I've been through it with you
Multiple times on many occasions
Contemplating vacating without you, I doubt you the one
I could be wrong; I could be sprung; I could be dumb
I could be dumbfounded, well-rounded
Plus the head game therapeutic
She knew when she blew it like Nintendo, you heard me
Some of y'all better curve me, my dick game army strong
My only hope is my song go on for long
This life ain't promised whether you accomplished
What you think about inside of yo' apartment

Bad luck to talk on these rides

I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body

So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

We got so familiar

If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'

I'ma make you dark like it's late in the day
No matter what I think, you gonna hate what I say
Earnhardt blunts, smoking like we in a race
Friends turn cold like the blood in my veins
Thoughts in my mind, like the dirt in my graves
So I press my head to the wall, till it breaks

[Chorus]
Take you back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether 'cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold
[Verse 2]
Get out the cold, get out the cold
Life's too tough, bitch, please let me know
I take your life and turn it to gold
Roll my dope and turn to a ghost
Who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!
Said who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!

[Verse 3]

Feelin' something, like Rick Moranis
Blew up the kid, now he doin' damage
You oughta know, like my name’s Alanis
Hate on me, take a seat, young Christopher Hansen
I don't sweat all day, just to lie in a mansion
Break blunts, like glass, when you get the banshee
R2, R2, L1, R2, up, down, left, right
Then I get to bangin'

[Chorus]
Take you back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow

How in the fuck are you 'bout to say
The way that we do it is not the way?
No, don't you sweat it, you not in the way
Nothing you do can put an end to my day
Cashed as fuck, in my bed I lay
Look at the ceiling and fade away
Stressin' and checkin' on me for a blessin'
But I can't hear nothing, I'm gone for the day
Sure you can afford that? I get it
Lookin' like a bum, only think I'm holdin' pennies
Pull out your mortgage, just spend it in a minute
Take it how you want it, get mad when you get it
Blame everyone around you for the money you ain't gettin'
Boy, man up to the life you ain't livin'
Times, they get chiller, sometimes I forgive him
My mind's on a rhythm, so don't fuck up when I see you
Loose neck, cotton chains bangin' off my body soundin' like a dog walkin'
Razor barkin' if you by me, let the scotch light blind 'em, let the switch restyle 'em

No good for my health, not good to myself, I am no use to anyone

Now I can only trust my reaction, gotta learn to walk without ending up in traffic
Lights off just staring at the wall, cut to me, lights on, just nobody home

[Verse 2]
I'm shaking, I'm panicking, seconds I'll never get back
'Cause I threw 'em away like some evidence
Ready for reckoning, smoking, no questioning

Look at the burial, see the resemblance
Between myself and the ones who I've ended
Hope it's to me that they pay no attention
Shoo 'em away to my dungeon I vanish
Deadboy, I could never ever stop, no
Yelling underground but you making pop songs
I could lie and say you got something going on
But since day one, bitch, you got it all wrong
Always living in contrast and trying to compare
Wish they could feel okay in the skin they wear

Put your whole damn body in a fucking hurdle

Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit

Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say ""ugh!"", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
""You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street""
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

The boy spit like he made out of 409

Watchin' the sands of the hourglass
Sharpen the blades for the circumstance
Sit in the dark while I'm in a trance
Takin' that blade, then I let it pass
Through my wrist, blood just drips
Down and down and down, don't stop
Then my blood starts to clot—my heartbeat has been stopped
Urge to kill, pop more pills, robbin' the pharmacy

Bring my prey back down to my cellar
More bodies than a serial killer, not scared of no pigga

Cover the whole world up in ash
And then laugh at the fact that I destroyed the past, fade to black
All my racks stained with back pain
All my gold chains in blast range
Ask myself, ""Do I lack fame? Or am I famous 'cause I lack pain?""
Numb to the stains, numb to the game
Numb to the racks that they gave me, fuck it all, I take it back

The hands go up, but they always come down
That's the sad truth when you're living for the crowd
The show's been over, but you still wanna bow
You really should hang it up but you're just too proud
The beat's too low, and the vocal's too loud
Even in the booth you've been havin' little doubts
You put your headphones on and drink 'till you pass out
Praying for a drought help you shake your dark cloud

[Bridge]
I've not even been around the block
Not even once but I look out the door
The corner's right there, the coast is clear
My eyes are open but I'm hating the chore
No reason to stop now there's nothing but pop clowns
So put your money down put your neck on the table
You feeling so hot now, you're calling the shots now
Switch things up, you gotta shake that label
[Verse 1]
Call it what you want, call it what you gotta
It's a struggle in the booth to make the truth sound hotter
Make you feel proper make you feel just right
And it's some insecurities just to help you sleep at night
So fall back if you don't feel me. I don't even feel me!
Sometimes I think that I do this shit to try and heal me
Maybe be appealing maybe grow a fan base
But honestly I only make this music for my own sake
You want my own take? Here's my two cents
I don't need your recognition just a record with depth
An intense one that just lets me just vent
One that knows when I'm happy or I wanna get bent
And guess what homeboy? that's all I ever need
Introspection over beats and a party for the fiend
A CD full of a songs and a mic for me to speak into
If music speaks to you please take heed:
Think about it, write it down, find someone who you can teach it to
I'm not preachin' dude, I'm just trying to cleanse
A lyrical colonic, shake the demons in my head
Sometimes you've gotta purge yourself to make it out of bed

The hands go up, but they always come down

Inspiration don't come cheap these days
So I go the opposite direction tryin' to keep this faith
No religion, but hip hop has given me the opportunity
To put a hundred percent into something that is true to me
And Usually my muses show up so I start sippin'
Allow me to gas myself so I stop trippin
And overthinking and analyzing everything I do
So I can find out what life looks easier for you
How the hell did I develop all of this social anxiety
And fuck a zoloft! I roll off and get high
With these bottles and beers, trying to forget those years
I don't need a script doctor, but let's just say cheers
And tip that, say sip sip sippin' on the jazzers
And when your people join you , then you know it's going to be magic
But when you're on a vision quest, they say that it's a hazard
But trust me, I would never let it turn to something tragic
There's been to many kids lost in my home town
Must be something in the water shed, 'cuz I know now
Suicidal teens ain't born, they're bred
So give them something to hope for instead of pullin' the thread
Unravellin' all of their dreams at the seams
I believe in doing for self, but it's nice having a team
That's why I self medicate just to help meditate
Introspection is arrestin' when you can't catch a break
[Hook]
The hands go up, but they always come down
That's the sad truth when you're living for the crowd

[Breakdown / Verse 3]

The 16s we rip 'em, the pen's scribbles explicit
Mic booth is a closet until the studio's finished
Gaurenteed that when we get legit I'm going to miss it
But until then we circle the rag and stay on the mission
A hotbed of ideas, our pens are best friends
I've driven through carpal tunnel, that's hell but the road ends
We've blazing our own path, we work as our own staff
No paychecks get cut, but fuck we'll get past
I stay sipping the bourbon and even though it's a weakness
I need it to find the freedom to make real what I keep dreamin
I mean it, I promise I can surely keep my seams sewn up
As long as I only have to pretend to be a grown up
These headphones are worn, the paint's starting to fade
High's starting to clip, lows starting to wane
But no need to worry, the musics gonna get made
And even when we pass out, wake up to a new day like

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job

[Verse 2]
I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go

Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death

Three percs fizzle at the bottom if you don't know

From a pile of skeletons still sitting in my front lawn
Drawn to the shadows, call me Shadowkhan
Crawl to the gallows, now the shadow gone
Born with an arrow, sharp
With a broken bow, aim it at the fucking battlefront

Saw a car crash, it remind me of our first date
Then I went back, got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin' this shit alone
Callin' my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin' my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit don't even make me scared no more
Man, I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin' up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody, never on my own
But today I'm by myself and I don't even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You don't get me but I don't blame you, I don't get myself
Pressin' on keys, got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitch's pinned tweet man
Bumpin' oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now, and I can't help but listen
She go, ""Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh""
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I won't show
Expectation high, I feel like a drone
2018, I got some new goals
Not checkin' my statement 'til I got 4 mill
Rushin' all year like I commit roadkill
Killin' everybody like I'm in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work 'til I'm tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon' depend on what I say

Ayy, hold up, wait a second
Man, my flow on lethal weapon
Hit 'em with the rhymin' pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha I'ma get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon' need another fella, ayy
I don't take drugs, I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon' make her choke like reflux, gotta relax
Man, yo' shit is borin' and it's makin' me go sleep fast
And I always care 'bout everybody but myself
That's the life of a Virgo, never gettin' mad
That's not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart, it's about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she 'bout 30 years old
Rappin' on this instrumentals, feelin' like a hero
Never usin' triplet flows because I'm not a Migo
Only lastin' longer 'cause I'm drunk, I don't think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend

I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story45Embed"

I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical

I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Airforce knockoffs with the Gucci print material

I'm talkin' 'bout nextel chirps and Boost mobiles

Now I'm seein' tear drops on you Soundcloud niggas
Remember back when music had content and metaphors
Way before the mumble nonsense and poppin' handlebars

[Verse 1]
All these rappers junkies talkin' like they dope dealers
One song a scammer, the next song they killers
First time I shot the gun, the neighbors called the people
I was watchin' 12 search for shells like Easter
That's around the time they shot my Daddy for the Rollie
Round the same time AI lost to Kobe
Platinum FUBU summers, rockin' Iceberg in the winter
Gold bag Hermes ain't no Sprewell Spinners
Fuckin' up computers, usin' Limewire or BearShare
Bootleggin', boostin', sellin' CD's at the daycare
Savin' up guala, bean bag for my stash spot
Momma still ask me how the fuck I get that Xbox
Round the first time I saw my uncle smokin' crack rock
In The Flinstones, smokin' Pebbles like it's Bedrock
'Round the same time my pops was scammin' on that laptop
Still remember when my Uncle Sydney took that headshot
I was tryna get them Jordan 17, deadstocks
Used to hoop dream, pushin' rock on the blacktop
Started home invadin', kickin' combination padlock
Puttin' crack rock in the Figure-4 Leg Lock
I was hella young, watchin' Triple H & Ric Flair
Bust my head open play fightin' with a steel chair
Tryna be a wrestler almost put me in a wheelchair
Thankful for that Medicare welfare, healthcare

Nowadays I can't even walk in the store
Without these crazy-ass fans and boppin-ass hoes
Back in '04, a hoe said I wouldn't blow
Now every show I go? 3 or 4 give me dome
I was up in Vegas at the Mayweather party
Then my mama call me 'bout Hurricane Harvey
Said the house got flooded, water covered up the sofa
Impala, Range Rover, she need me to come over
Nowhere near sober, it was fuckin' up my night
Like, ""They gon' be alright. Tomorrow, book a flight""
Woke up, 40 missed calls, she was callin' all night
Said there's no more food and lights and she been fightin' for her life
Told Toby book the plane, I gotta be there by tonight
But all this hurricane rain made the airport cancel flights
I'm like, ""What the fuck how?"", I'm thinkin' like ""Wow""
Prayin' that she don't drown.. ""Dear Lord, just get her out""
She worked her whole life to move the family out the hood
Just to lose everything she had in the flood
Donald Trump and Red Cross actin' like some hoes
People drownin' in their homes 'cause they couldn't get a boat
Pops got a bad heart, last year he had a stroke
In his bed, off meds, couldn't swim, sink, or float
On the roof for three days before rescue by FEMA
12 years later, same day as Katrina
If you was in my shoes, you would prolly be stressin'
..But sometimes, God, He will bless you and test you
Every day I say my grace because I coulda lost my people
I still got cases, me and my brothers fightin' RICO

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to show you around imaginary places
Put money lumps in my bloody stump
And I will have a smile that's a perfect circle
Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet
I'll shoot you when you're happy, on the day that you will find peace
How do you do? I don't know I'm okay
Every person I know is a secret service agent
'Cause I'm accused of lewd conduct
Stole the heart of a prude prom slut
And they got the warrant for my arrest to put me in
The loony bin, the funny farm, because of what I did
[Verse 2: Busdriver]
But I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
There is not a single person who can do it better
No needle skippin in my ecosystem
But in the audience may be an evil Christian
HMO how I hate him so
But they charge me for a halo
But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a lavender chunk
Of the sky, maybe I'll replace it with a mud-pie
I play dead songs on the silk screen
Buy my shirt it is a killed dream
It is known to lead the way to the stairwell
To God's administrative office and a final farewell

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to give your assault rifle a banana clip
Glow in the dark when I stroll in the park
Givin everybody informative pamphlets!
No sign of life for as far as I can see
Everybody's just charred meat up in the car seat
Eat shit and die to the secret spy
'Cause I have a funny feeling that I'm being watched
24-hour surveillance
Money or power are ailments
But I send the medical supplies and the shipping
And the handling is way too much, 'cause I'm from the Afterlife

But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 1]
Oh Bambi I won't lie
If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it's my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
‘Cause now they know you are love of my life

I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between loving many and loving one
I got the wedding invitation Bambi
I'm happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church there screamin’ your name Bambi

Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised for the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort,"" talkin’ about “let’s make it great”

Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting

First, I turned the Nile River into blood!
Then I released the frogs as the city floods!
Along with lice, flies, and I diseased your livestock!
Then I make sure the boils grow on your wife and child!
Look up at the fucking sky, you'll see a storm of hail and fire!
Then I sent out the locusts to swarm your fucking crops!
I blacked out the sun and made time stop!
Next I'm coming for your firstborn son, watch him drop!

Makin' it fucking rain alligator fangs
Lightin' the flame that ignited the revelation of Osiris

And siphoned all of the water supply of Zion

Put it on a spike, and all of the sheep became enlightened, bitch

With teeth on a rope that surrounding my neck
Standing in fire, I'm God of the liars

This is anti-clean rap, nigga, where the green at?
Risks I take, you'd swear I had the balls the size of beanbags
Not what you're used to, bitch, I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fools Gold, jeans with medusas

Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, guess what that makes you?
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fail
'Cause they don't care about music, just first-week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thing on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it's skeet-skeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch, I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch, I ain't Puffy

Sent your bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses

Ate a couple pills and took the bud up out the plastic
Flickin' bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she save money on her ga-bortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Coverin' Too $hort, smokin' a Newport
Hurt, hoped the drugs would help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dyin' in the arms of a blonde, blue-eyed twenty-something
Don't know her name, but the paramedics chest pumpin'
Thirty-something Black male OD'd off of pills
That he weren't prescribed, but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoodie on and a jacket in the snow
Walkin' in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the 'net
Niggas tried to front like I wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the oven's never closed and the stove's never off
Every winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gon' get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on to prove that voice right
Some people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat
Pitchin' singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now
When I turned twenty-eight, they like, ""What you gon' do now?""
And now a nigga thirty, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest

Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that
[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

My liver really startin' to slack, and I can feel myself decayin' from the cigarette packs
I haven't thought of $UICIDE since I was livin' in the back of Blackout's pad, my heart torn in half
Now I've got everything I ever wanted, but now I don't want it
It feels like I'm haunted, it feels like I'm cursed, hopefully soon I'll return to the dirt
A material world with a virtual nerve, yeah, I'll see what it's worth, throw me out on the curb
Leave me behind, walk a straight line to hell, as y'all swerve away, lost in the choice not to sell
Roll me up a blunt, ayy, I need to get lost, ayy
All y'all talkin' 'bout sauce, I'm wipin' frozen cuts with frost
I'm slicin' open guts, and tossin' frauds off to the side, half of $uicide
A couple million, now we're ready to fucking die
[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
Two cups and a bad bitch, then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix, call Nick when I need that itch
Call Krez just to pop on 'phetamine, Max Beck in the back; pop seventeen
Yung Kurt Cobain with the heroin, $lick love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah, but look at your bankroll
So? Just spend it on more dope, more woes, fuck you care for?
But lately, I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it, and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in an empty hotel lobby

[Refrain: $LICK $LOTH]
4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and the need for death
4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?

Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

Oh, you got a man? Are you in love? If so, what type?

I just wanna tell you real quick please shh
I love, these scones
Just the diversity between the selection
The raspberry, the blueberry
The strawberry, pumpkin, even
Which is basically a fucking squash
How do you even make a scone out of a freaking squash?

What was he saying? What was he talking about?
Oh my god, that’s crazy

She is like the nicest person I’ve ever met in my whole life
And I’m sure you know it ‘cause you sleep next to her every night
And you guys would probably cuddle and kiss or whatever
But she, you know, she is just so sweet and she cared about me a lot when no one else cared about me and I think that’s really nice
Really you know, she’s just a, she's just a peach
She’s a peach, scone
She's a peach scone, Bob
[Outro]
And I love the thought of being with her
I just really hope that she doesn’t get hurt, man
They say it takes two years to come back down to earth
From that lovely place that you’ve been, I heard it’s so nice
I heard it’s so nice, good for you, I’m glad
And if you find someone that really loves you for who you are
Keep being with them, man
‘Cause that’s what matters in this life, Bob, thank you12Embed"

(It feels so good)
Ugh...
Oh, that's my shit right there
That's the ticket, gimme the ticket
Give it to me baby
You know it!

[Verse 1]
I'm too emotional
Good luck to my future wives and their future lives without me
You guys will do great
I'm sure that I've prepared you for every guy you'll date
And every guy you'll marry and every guy you'll hate
It's the lullabies I sang out of tune, that's probably what did it
Or my twin size mattress that I had since I was 7
That we have to sleep on whenever she spends the night
And if she falls off again, she'll find another guy to like
[Chorus]
We're just Romeo and Juliet
But getting drunk and eating Percocets
But just to ease the stress
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony

[Verse 2]
How romantic
Nothing like getting drunk and getting manic on a motherfucking Monday, I
I brush the bangs behind her lovely little ear
As she describes in detail how the end is truly near, wow
And I'm sure that we can do this for forever
Or until we drink the poison 'cause she sees some cloudy weather
As Rosaline, lies in bed, seething, wide awake
Because a burning love for Juliet only took a day
And if Romeo and Juliet continued to be married
Then there's half of a chance that their kids would get embarrassed
When all the kids at school all talk about their parents
And Romeo Jr. has to say they're not together
And Junior will dream of the day when he's a man
And what he'll do to avoid that 50% chance
Of his kids feeling the way he feels
He'll probably just stick with the Netflix and Chill

[Bridge]
Dear Shakespeare
Could you write a happy ending, please?
Could you write a happy ending, please?
We just deserve a happy ending, please, please

And every sting from every teardrop
From every ring at every pawn shop
I'm not missing both my Christmases, though family would be nice
In my dreams, my kids are happy, and I know that they won't mind
One Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas

[Outro]
But dear Mom
Conversations from a couch haven't ever felt the same
Since you looked Dad in the eye, and you told him that things are about to change
My mom was made from Adam's rib, and the marriage went south
When the snake came back and asked my mother out to dinner
And my dad found out, and asked my mom what that's about
And she said, ""Oh, it's nothing,"" but Dad loves to shout really loud
Loud enough to knock the lamps and dressers to the ground
In my memory, I can hear
Chopin's nocturnes playing in the background
A slow train wreck, you'll close your eyes but forever hear the sound
And boy, it's tough
'Cause that's the sound of people falling out of love15Embed"

Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova

Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I parked my Range Rover
Slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us

I don't wanna get too heavy
Have her one night, bet you wanna marry
I'm off some shrooms in a place where you cannot be
Three jellyfish in a dungeon where reptiles be
I feel your love and I see it inside of me
Value your friendship, we drink 'til it's over, see
I got that laser, it's shooting right out of me
Red lava, red fish, red tablets, all growing free
You imbeciles try to be, but you cannot be
My money was small, but I made it grow rapidly, rapidly

Spiders on my feet but you be caught up in the web

Smoking on some sour in Bahamas
Wearing green Polo pajamas, made of marijuana
Fuck an ugly hoe, like Johnny Drama
Licking off, dripping champagne from my fingernail
Tripping off ginger ale
This tune ain't got no hook
Like a monkey tail
Me and Pedro on this bitch
Wearing aventail
On the beach, with the pink polo
The color of rose, dirty stinking feet
Started drinking whiskey neat
Birdie shrinkin' tree
Yung Lean, it's that curly-haired freak
Take a seat
Got a new passport
Eating lobster in court
Teleport to a new timezone with an escort
Got a fort filled with hoes that just want to snort
Take that boat to my resort
In Hawaii, where I got a tennis court
I forgot to mention that I still get child support

Drinking 40s out in Honolulu
With my shawty and she's siftin' on chicken pu-pu
I'm in doo-doo
Hoes sucking nuts but this ain't no Chippendales
Drifting fails, off a drifting tale
Made of minimum wage
Starring in shit movies like Nicolas Cage

Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits

You ain't got a number, then I guess we gotta get you covered

Said you could run, but my niggas will still erase ya
Everywhere I go, they just copy and paste us

The gracious, he never lace the shit, take a trip
To the astrals, welcome to my land 
It's your first OBE? Tell me how has your body been?
Spinning wheels on the axle of my embodiment
Don't waste your breath, you can't BS, we know what your body meant
Through third eye codes, your third eye closed
If Steve Jobs made you purchase a third iPhone
All seeing eyes know what eye means
But 33 degrees can't make us freeze
Said they watered us down so they forced to believe
That they won us through force and greed

Down, but it ain't happening, we mad as shit
Still managing, girl can I bust if I got cannabis?
A half a zip could have her pants unzipped
Ain't enough romantic shit, so don't be sadden if you couldn't have a kiss
I'm still a bastard kid with blackened lips; I'm still a
Pacifist, but if you ask for it, then I could pass a fist
You don't smoke -ism, I'll introduce you, not a buddah
Abuser, feel like a Bad Boy when I take two puffs, I and I
Be stoned so Mary Jane is like Medusa, had keys
For dough, would have thought he was a super, but that's when I grew up
To realize I'm in a place to be
Made vacancy and still the emcee, they know they can't see, we part of the
Resistance, we'll fix things, persistence, we shifting
We drifting, we lifted

Back me up if the tourin' fails

And I'm so for that, take control of that

Passin' out and then buy you somethin' foreign

""You die and then you live, huh?""

Bad apple, daily clashin' with my kinfolk
Bad acid did damage to my mental

Hold me down, hold me up
Hold me close 'cause my times is up
Show they true colors, don't know who to trust
Mind workin' like the water when it rush
Growin' from my father, bitter to his touch
Now I'm solely honor, livin' is a must
All this for my momma 'til I'm dust

Got me in a jam, I be in my feelings
On the other hand, I just need a moment
Offer my condolence, smokin' 'til the mornin'

Brodie on the corner with a piece on his hip
Give a warning 'fore you blow it in the sky
Tiptoein' over mortar and the brick
Bumpin' shoulders with the devil in disguise
Shoulder-level water on the rise
Twist, 40s in the morning in the winter
I heard you got your sauce at the Enterprise
Evidently, it was rented but it's mine
Evidently, it was written like Nas
I was in the kitchen with that nigga Mike
Gotta listen when I tell ya simmer down
Two years I've been missin', livin' life
You was wildin', every day was trash
Crackers pilin' in to rape the land
Early morning, wash my swollen hands
Hit the showers, cleanse my soul and crash
Tiptoein' over glass, brodie go too fast, told him slow up
Know I use too much of everything at hand
Except the difference is now I control it, I be
In the crib and in the moment, stuck sippin' out the flask
Feet up on the dash, I hit the spliff but don't promote it
Under overpass, no cap
Sand fallin' out the hourglass
Grand total, it's a whole lotta raps
Quicksand, scramblin' outta that
Go behind the back, switch hands

Sterilize your clique, paralyze maritime niggas when
Every time Wavy Don tappin' in

I've been this awkward since adolescence, I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure, I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept, I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin', I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty, surely deservin' of all this lonely
""You sad? Tell me, how are you sad? You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans"", I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in

It still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'

Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk like two dimes
No time, social interaction
Had female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
'Cause the friendships that I can't recall
Done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with
Doin' shit that I can't endorse now

""New Orleans is ruled by thugs even more ruthless than LA's most violent gangs.""
""The Crips & Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed them. Simple as that—gone! See you later!""
""We look at gangs like this, it's like a coward move to us. But a gang, it takes fifteen people to get in two cars and do a drive-by and kill one person. In New Orleans, I just saw one person kill fifteen people.""

[Chorus: Juvenile]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is, to make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire

You know what it is, to make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t be cryin' and sufferin'
[Verse 1: WHO BOY BOY]
Definition of the living dead, got a dead bitch givin' head
Tulip flowers growin' on my bed, rust and blood settle on my lead
Broken soul, but I'm breaking bread
Head-dreaded boy from Waggaman
Petey Pablo shirt off, on 'em, swingin' like a helicopter
Got it covering this chopper, spittin' out them yoppas
Got the drama with the llama, I can get you to Nirvana
Run them pockets proper, we create our own karma
Balboa out the Magnolia, Northside Soulja
Need the keys to the Rover
Yung $carecrow-a

Mumblin' nothing, just the discussion of public destruction
I'm up in flames, the Soulja by the lake
Feelin' like I'm in the Navy, but I pull up in the tank, ayy
Sippin' the tang out of an AK, kangaroo the next lane
Lame move, you looking plain
Can't redo the flex, mane
Camo on my body like I just got back from the war

Back in New Orleans, now everybody wanna score

My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full

Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is that so bad for you?

I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you

Tell them hoes right now to get the fuck out my face

Heart is cold and I can't even feel my fuckin' face

And I'm in a real bad mental state, yuh

Ask all your friends if they know 'bout your size of shoes
How you like to cry when you laugh, when you off the booze
I moved on but I still remember a thing or two
I know you said, ""Gimme a hug,"" and I said, ""Gimme a break""

They need some coffee, everybody sleepin' on me
Goin' round door-to-door, settin' off alarms (Beep, beep, beep)
All that horse shit, you shoulda left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in a arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth (Amen)
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Blame the drugs, got me sinnin' on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway (Skrrt)
Givin' y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I'm in it in an instant like replay
Broad's a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?, she say
""I thought you got sober,"" then I said
""I wish you'd stop bein' a bitch and get to mindin' your business""
Told me, ""Money has changed ya""
I get to thinkin', how rarely do I visit? How'd I get so egotistical?
I'm a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it'll forever be

And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon
Alright, godspeed

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Ah, yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressin', I can't relax
Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what's makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin'
Sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
The pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up
Admit it's a problem, I need to wake up
Before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin' if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'
Yeah, good mornin'

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you in MIA for

You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where
You're always afraid to take the first step

But you can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing

Mornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you could be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before

Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for her
You wanna leave? Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, ""Is everything okay?""
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long

Well
Take your vitamins!

[Verse 1]
Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, ""Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of lungs, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke""
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, ""Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the front, 'cause we just put new carpets in""
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, ""We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around""
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, ""Just relax,"" she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it (Love it)
[Chorus]
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

[Verse 2]
I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, ""Fuck it,"" took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

7th Ward swerving, white Benz, wheels turnin'
Rose gold chrome accent on the rims, picture perfect
No destination, let's just wait and see where we end up
Burnin' zones, burnin' up the ozone
Backwood stay tightly tucked
Bitch look at me, she said ""Yuck, what the fuck?"", ho, I'm Oddy Nuff
I don't fuck with lifeforms of this planet, bitch, you out of luck
I got better shit to do like sip the lines up in my cup
I ain't sharing, pint stay tucked
Waste my whole life hunting ducks

""The flows on this thing generally are pretty tight, it seems almost as if there is a slightly larger focus on hooks with this project, too, some of which really pop, like on the track 'Nicotine Patches'. One day I'll forget their name...!""

[Verse 2: LIL HALF CUT]
I be that rotten garbage crawlin' out the ditch, stitches for a snitch
Bodies in the fridge, blade scraping
Grey aping, banging on my fucking chest
Feel the static, problematic, be my motherfucking guest
Yung Christ, masked up for a poltergeist
Feel like I'm stuck in a vice, feel like I been paid my price
My wrists have been sliced
Now they're scarred from the blade that's pressed against my skin
Lifeless and I'm stuck up in this shit
The walking Mortal Sin, whose lives will never end, fuck

Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie

God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL

But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it

I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I have my pops inside my life, but right now that shit don't matter
He'd been locked up most my life, so I feel just like a bastard
Police kickin' in my door, threw my momma on the floor
HPD took my pops, I bought a heat, hit the block
I was in them streets like speed bump, potholes, V12-auto Forgiato
'Lenciaga, no red bottoms, I don't rock no Ferragamos
I was Maxo Kream, El Chapo, dodgin' narcos get you knocked off
Black suburban swervin' make me nervous when I'm making drop offs
Used to handle rock like hot sauce, call the hot sauce get you knocked off
He ain't got no chill, he kill for real, and he 'gon blow your top off
Genesee Street, I took the top off, bitch with me she took her top off
Dick ain't hard, she sucked me on soft, hole-in-one, her mouth like Tiger
Forever never, not sober, the city of double cuppers
We beefin' this place and mothafuck you, your sister, your brother
I'm clutchin' gun in my holster, Beretta wet 'em like coasters
They shot my pops and my brother, so I slide with choppas like butter
Pop toasters, let go my ego, for pesos give you a halo
Locked up my pops and took my brother, so my daddy was my mother
Hit the stove, stealin' candy, got grown, start servin' xannies
Momma told me hit the do', she ain't want dope around her family
Moved in with my grandma, servin' grannies at my grannies
Momma couldn't stand me, say I act just like my daddy
Fist fightin' Pirus, I hit the school with the Ruger
Had to take my .52, and hopped on Five-Deuce Hoover
I was a young nigga in the streets, I ain't know nothin'
Ain't no big homie tell me shit, on my own thuggin'
Bad ass, actin' up in class, I ain't learn nothin'
Reminisce on my first lick, I hit for four onions
I turned that four into a sixteen, and now I'm road runnin', hey
Trap house scorchin', use the stove and the oven
Every time I stashed it in the house, my brother stole from me
And I was down bad, and on my ass, nobody rode for me, hey

They got shot up with a K, I got good and bad news
They say Redro gon' be straight, but Sto Groove ain't make it through
They hit Redro with a eight, only hit Sto Groove with two
'Round this time last year in May, crackhead junkie killed Young Doof
I seen your stupid baby momma, she still actin' like a thot
Always fightin', startin' drama, she be fuckin' with the opps
Asked her why she never write you, why she never help you out
She say you trippin', you don't listen, and your temper always hot
But let me tell you 'bout your daughter, yesterday, she tried to walk

Don't think a nigga tryna ignore you, I'm just handlin' business
On my way here, I was blowin' and they told the lieutenant
Word got back to the warden and they canceled my visit
I dropped 40 on a lawyer, tryna reduce your sentence
He better than that court-appointed, he gon' fight to appeal it
But you gotta stop trippin', I heard they caught ya with a phone
And they threw you in the hole, you probably wonder how I know
I miss them days when we was mobbin', we was robbin' just for fun
If you was fightin', then we fightin', jump 'em, ain't no one on one

You went in every nigga pockets and got money for my bond
I know you really miss them streets, but you ain't really missin' none
I know this rap shit look real sweet, but my real life, it ain't no fun
'Cause right now, I'm out on bond, my dude, he on probation
My lil' bro on the run, he think he on vacation
My pops back in the system, he just might die in prison
My mom is co-defendant, so she got locked up with him
He got snitched on by his own sister, she the eyewitness
Now every time I see my blood cousins, I don't even feel 'em
See what them drugs, they took my own cousins, started actin' different
Cookin' drugs with my older brother, bakin' soda whippin'
Servin' drugs with my older brother 'til he started sniffin'
I think my bro addicted
I tried to put my nigga on and then he ended up stealin'
I caught that nigga stealin' crumbs when I was plottin' on millions
Believe in death before dishonor, Father God, please forgive him
I pray to God 'cause if I see him, swear to God, I'ma kill him
I got some change, my niggas changed, I'm gettin' change, they think I'm rich
They want me locked up in a cage, I'm fightin' RICO just like Mitch

Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth

Couple rainbows, my lil' halo

Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach

Chill, have a spliff, walk Jasper
Lost a dog drunk on vodka
Responsibility another chapter

Never had a mortgage, buy my house outright

There's like a memory of my stepdad when I was very young
He said to me that he got tickets to Liverpool, yeah
'Cause I used to love football, bruv
It was my dream and all this, the first time
And he's like, ""I'll take you,"" and like, ""Yeah, we've got tickets""
So on the way there, it's like, uh
Obviously, to Liverpool it's like a six-hour train or something
And he's like... oh, we're on the train
And I'm lookin' into my football magazine, like I'm mad young
And I was like, ""Dad, I swear if, um, like this team's name's first
They're at their home ground
Like if it's like West Brom verse Liverpool, it's at West Brom, yeah?""
And he's like, ""Nah, I don't know""
And I'm like, ""Nah, it definitely is, yeah""
So then we had to hop off at West Brom, which was easier
But we got there bare early
So there we were, just gotta wait around
And I'm like, ""Have you got a ticket?""
And he's, like, telling me, ""Yeah,"" he's like, ""Yeah, I've got tickets""
And then, bruv, this whole time, we're just looking for a tout
Like a ticket tout to buy tickets to the game
Like for hours, we missed the first half of it
And it was like, I always remember bein' so pissed that
'Cause it was like, man lied to me, innit, after everything
If he said to me, ""I ain't got the tickets,"" I wouldn't have even bothered

I'm goin' down to the Railway Station, gonna get a ticket to ride
Find a big fat lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet

[Verse 1]
And get along with it all
Go down where the people say ""y'all""
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again
[Verse 2]
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

[Verse 3]
I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna get a ticket to ride

We could ever be what you plan to be, ayy, ayy
I said girl, I'll set the record straight
I’ve got shelves of them, just go press play
We could spin it all, you don't have to be alone

[Chorus: Alexa & Forrest]
She said nine-to-five, I'm killing time
But twenty-four-seven, three-six-five
I'd have to be where I feel your sunshine

[Verse 3: Forrest]
From the sand, to my surprise
She comes to me and locks my eye
Says boy, you know what, I guess you're alright
She said I don't mean to make this hard
But trust me, boy, I've got these scars
If you hit and run, you know that won't get you far
I said girl, you've got it set in stone
If you lay the mat, I'll call you home
I'll make you mine and you'll never be alone

Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, ""Where are we from?""
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean

Old friends inquiring about the cash flow (Okay, okay)
Okay, this kush here in the gaseous state

These boys fake, please quit with the masquerade, ayy

But you had me pressed on arrival
Spent too many nights on my own
Now you're all I see when the lights low

You seem unsettled, touch my arm
Just keep the pressure, mine 'til dawn

We'll get out of town, leave the coast here
It's a two-day drive if we both steer
Make sure to pack for the cold years
We'll be just fine if we're close, dear

No, it wouldn't be the first time, I won't mind

Couldn't keep these feelings tucked inside

Still haven't left like I promised
Waiting for you if I'm being honest
Been a while since I've known what I've wanted
It's you 'til the days that we're rotten

Laughing in the face of death
Higher than a space cadet
Aspire to greater steps
Kill the game, I arrive just to pay respect
All that talking that you do is cheap, you ain't making sense
Breaking bread, boy, you couldn't break a thread
Making threats, boy, you couldn't make a friend
Take offense, over something someone says you said
You get slept, make your bed, no escape, save your breath
K, what's next? These boys hardly harder
I'm like a modern Charlie Parker mixed with Ali Baba
Leave these kids more fucked up than that Molly got 'em
Like a Lil Scrappy song, you don't want no problems
Sigh oddly, then reply calmly
Lie to me, then rely on me
The day is gone, this is after-light
But I'm like an old school singer, I'm Gladys Knight
Corbin asked me if I'm scared of dying
The more I think about it, I'm kind of excited
Maybe that's because my mind is sick and demented
But death ain't shit but a new adventure
Death ain't shit but a new adventure
[Verse 2: Corbin]
You don't see, but I've been holding back
Tempted to do off, end it all at that
You can help me if your aim is pure
But there's no medicine, you know the cure
And I could be low, but I fake, it's my fate
Ooh, and I could be alone, why wait on?

Give it up, we—

[Verse]
Somebody tooted in the student commons
The bell rang
He went home then argued in the comments
I watched the doppler move
I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point
My noose is golden
True and livin'
Lonesome
Pugilistic moments
Riveting
Come get to know me at my innermost
My family business anguished, now I need atonement
I set the goals
Half my wings is broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing too much love
My sister showed in a rut
We getting over sinning up
Living in the moment, you been corrupt
Have some ginabut
Since a jit I figured what's the use in giving up
I can't give enough
Shilajit in my sippy cup
Healing cuts
But willingly I'm refilling the pump
No concealing it
Enemy up in arms bearing snubs
They just freakin' see the cub
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck
Pieces in slums
One
Peaking in the dust, weaving
I remember woods
I remember endo when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love
Healing the ruptures
Feeling rushed, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th, give it up
Gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit

Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel

Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em
She save my name in her phone
Only thing she save me under is probably that ""U"" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)
Jeremy Scotts all on my feet
I had a cougar with me, so I call that girl Coretta (Coretta)

I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather (Facts)

I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole

Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
Nineteen with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, ""Broski, you a star""
I said, ""Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large""
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage

For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated

Shorty being one with the music
Shorty wanna swing like a New Jack
City got my brain on night mode
'Til shorty hit it with the high note
Feeling like a highlight reel
All real, no time for no timeouts
Hit you with the two piece
Peace, peace, peace 'cause I don’t do no violence
Said she wanna freak with me 'cause she see I’m a G and a pilot
Whole lotta weed and it loud 'cause you know that we don’t do no silence

Try to play me like a pussy nigga and it won't work
Choppa with the stock, it's gon' kick, but it won't hurt
Turn this bitch sideways, rip him like some homework
Sneak up in his trap under the bed like a monster
Pop up out the cut with the choppa, who's the owner?
Today, you're not a trap-star, today, you are a donor
I don't wanna cool it with the thot, I'm tryna bone her
She throw the pussy on me like I put it in a corner
I made a movie with a opp thot, she say I cloned her
She got Stussy on, that bitch basic and this won't work
Every slut hot, like a rapper at a concert
She says peep game, play her like some poker
I said, ""Yes,"" dentist said, ""Are you a smoker?""
OG cookies and pussy niggas, 'cause I do both
And I asked her what the dick did, and murder she wrote
And she wanna give me more head, but my dick hurt her throat
Come here, bitch, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Run up on Lil Tay-K, you ain't runnin', you gon' float
She don't like Bloods, says she never had a Loc

Lunatic with no motive, bitch, smokin' on some Whitney
Bobby Brown, hope no cops around, but fuck 'em if they are
Pig killer, mixed with gorilla—we the lords of chaos
See, these motherfuckers can't touch me
Run up, bitch, I'm clutchin'
Thirty shots, I'm dumpin', in that bitchboy you fucking
[Chorus: Miguel]
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
Between you and I, as simple as pie, baby

[Verse 2: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Six-six, bitch, you can bet I'm on the shit-list
Dope sick, fix your lisp, spit with my whole fist
No tricks, goal kicks, no toe licks, spit pole cold
Rich assholes shit gold bricks
Stick with show business
Your record gets more skips than a lunch-line
Sometimes punch lines are played out all about hump fine bitches
Hittin' switches, getting riches
Fucking one time was enough
I'm from the motherfucking underground, we don't slip
Independent rippin' off pendants, and sendin' it to your bitch
So she can reminisce about the time I slipped her the dick
I mean she fucking asked for it
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Ruby da Cherry the mixed berry fucking smoothie, so smooth

What?

[Verse]
The boy in the bubble, the furthest from trouble
When I look at you, it's like damn
You give me sympathy practically instantly
I feel so bad, like, how could I be mad?
You on some shit I don't want
You on some shit I done did
We all got idols but don't feel too high up
And fall to an untimely end
Go ahead out with your friends
I'ma stay in and make ends
Meet, like a blind date
Fuck what the time say
If it ain't five to SESH then I can't
You yet to see the best that I can
Earth will end if Bones get uncanned
Sherpa lined everything, let them see every stain
Fifty-nine everyday, burnt to the membrane
Flashback slumped in the breezeway
Thinkin' I can't do this shit forever
Fuck doing their way, I'ma go my way
Hundred highways not long enough for my race
I'ma take it further than that
All these pussies think they take it further than rap, no
You take it nowhere quick, nobody give a fuck 'bout the money that you get
And if you convince yourself any different
It's safe to say you gone and been missing
Off in a land I could have predicted
Molded by thoughts of those who don't get you
The scum has arisen
And, no, bitch, don't tempt me
'Cause I have been patiently waiting for my time to lose it
Please, come and offend me
Feeling something like Larry David
Observe the world and then I get to shamin'
Shit go wrong, I'm the one they blamin'
While the rest get on stage and they blow it like Kramer
Stranger-stranger, who really stranger?
'Cause I don't know you but I know my anger
Worried 'bout your album, say you need more bangers
Bones never approach that ledge with danger
Say you a star, end the conversation
Me and my brothers make the constellation
I'ma get it now, I'm far from patient
Can't sit still, I forever go crazy
The store clerk know what I need when I walk in
Who bought out the bricks first night that they got in?
Who got what they need when they need it? I'll drop hints
I'm pointing all over, like, I promise it's not himYou might also like25Embed"

Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

Bitch, I step in your hood like it's Fly by Night
You got the nine? That's alright, 'cause hoe, I ain't 'fraid to die
Squeeze the trigger, lil' pussy, see yo' hand shaking
When Yung Christ get to walking, all the earth breaking
Koopsta Knicca reborn out the voodoo village
All these rappers fuckboys, and I've been sent here to pillage
Fuck a image, this my business that I put on record
You motherfuckers Dr. Hyde, and I'm Mr. Jekyll
Better yet the devil, antichrist dripped in gold
Flip the cross up on the chain

$carecrow and Yung $now, we see you bitches biting
All these posi' motherfuckers claiming $uicidal, eat my rifle
[Verse 2: YUNG OOZE]
Lucifer telling me that I better be in reverie
Lucifer begging me to return home
Travel the seven seas, Ruby da Cherry been burying memories
Cherishing dead enemies, never returnin' the throne
Please leave me the fuck alone
Fuck a hoe, plug up her soul
Find a puddle, grab a shovel, let's keep diggin' deep holes
The grass is always stained red when you slit your wrist
Grave wet from the rain, dead weight, remain dead and wait
Forever the grey, forever the grey
Forever the grey, and the five and the nine
And remember my name, remember my name
Remember my name when I die, don't reply to the devil inquiring
Souls for admiring, Satan perspiring, sign on the line
Ruby inspiring kids, get in line and see Lucifer
Buyer beware of the truth
And see you can be evil enough to let loose

You were not around

And tears were dripping from my eye
And I was feeling like I could die

Packed its bags to go

It was such a drag
And I could cry like nothing was right
And I could die in the dead of night

And so I cry my tear
So sorry you're not here

The love that never was

Tears that hate me, tears that fake me
And you know I gotta go
Tears that wake me, tears that have me
And I know you had to go away

Have we all gone mad?

Called him for a random search for curbside checkin' in

Running off at the mouth steady talkin' 'bout us
On some shit they overheard, but enough is enough
Yeah, it's neither here nor there, black

Hoes didn't holler last year feel sorry now
Practice jumpshots, Reggie Mill', Robert Horry now
The nigga that you with played like Atari now
Lyrically unorthodox, I flow continuous
Never on a straight path, I'm known to bend and twist
Put it down from the suburbs to the tenement
You betting 'gainst me, but wanna wonder where your money went
I get the cash, take niggas out like trash
Known to stack a mean stash, they used to call me Pure Math
Back in the days, all I did was stay paid
But as they say in the South, bitch, ""Give me some head""
Excuse me, Mister, do she got a sister?
Who he not to kiss her? True, she do got a blister
Now the movie plot twists like a Twizzler
If I needed my meat burnt, I'd go to Sizzler
Getting paid like a biker with the best crank
Spray it like a high-ranked sniper in the West Bank
Type to just blank and don't show much pity
When I'm in the city, I always keep a Dutch with me
Touch her titty 'til she ask me where the trees is at
Or tell me, ""Don't squeeze that,"" rats, wanna tease a cat

Hello dear

[Verse 1]
Look in my eyes, what you lookin' at me for? (Me for?)
You ain't seen a strap?
I got cats in flats with rebores, lean like Eeyore (Eeyore)
Mum said, ""Son, don't play with guns"" (Guns)
But the voice in my head kill everyone
Put a boy in the ER (ER)
One phone call can get a man gone
Pullin' up in a blacked out Beamer
You play too many games, these boys live in VR
I hate liars so I set fires, tie him up, then we pull with pliers
Boxin' your teeth out (Baow)
Gimme the loot, out of the loop
Call up the troops, too quick to shoot
No football boots, been the same since youts
And life weren't cute like K-K, K-K
You smoke too much kale, pint of lager
We don't do ale, man don't fail
Brother got twelve for a kidnap and didn't get no bail
Mac D's diet, loudest in the room and they should've stayed quiet (Shh)
Move in silence, then we get violent (Brrt)
Wet a boy up in his jumper, it's just like Poseidon
You don't know me, cat's O-D
Had to watch them die and shit gave me nightmares
Head in my hands, I was cryin', m-way speedin' in the right lane
Reach to your right and these lines that you're hypin'
Need to be enlightened
Roll to your crib and light it up like a photoshoot
What you know about lightin'?
What you know about lightin'?
[Chorus]
My allure (Ah), Pablo Escobar (Uh, uh)
Ain't up to par, I raise the bar (Haha)
I came from far (Up on there), up on Mars (Zoom, zoom)
Shootin' star (Shoot, shoot), kill a star (Eugh)

[Verse 2]
Talkin' wicked, man, you're a dickhead
Man, I break jaws
Round of applause, redefine physics
Turn you into a spirit, let nature take course
Big bang, blink and you miss it
If you went on the dole then you bottom out, raw
Begging on the floor for a nought point four
Shit that you did for a draw
Trackie bottoms in socks, take tills from shops
'Cause I never had a lot and I wanted more
Put a boy in a box, put a hole in the door
Like my name's Roy Shaw, I'm a pretty boy, course
Litty boy Short get fucked on all fours
Real men don't ever, ever say pause
Ringin' up my giff-gaff
You get Christmas gift-wrapped, call me Santa Claus
Banter me, we don't laugh or speak
I can see you're weak, had to tuck your tail
Tuck your chain, what you know about pain?
I can see it in your face, you're a pussy, you're frail
Mountain peak, council house, then I violate
Sniff cocaine 'til my eyes go dilate
I'ma dial it, like Dire Straits
How I move so far away?
Certain man don't wanna listen
Get beat up and they wan' play victim
If this was a movie, I'll be the villain
You'll be the bitch I'm killin'

I'm an addict to these women
I can’t stop these premonitions
Tellin' me it won’t end well but
I just never fucking listen
Can’t mistreat them so they like me
But they always fucking leave
Know the game so I can’t wife
I keep some on the side of me
She so bad to me, bad to me
Why I keep her comin' round?
Why can’t I just shut 'em down?
Her echoes yea I love the sound
The doors I keep em open while her clothes are fallin' to the ground
I'm hoping she won’t notice I ain’t new to this I get around
I'm stroking while she posing lowkey wishing she would stay

[Verse 1: NAV]
I'm a late bloomer, third year on the scene
Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me
Came from the streets, it turned me to a beast
Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload
I fuck the bitch I picked right out of Vogue
[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

[Verse 2: Gunna & Future]
Trappin' on the block, I'd never serve a cop
I always kept a Glock, I ain't 'bout to see the grave ('Bout to see the grave)
Pull up, I'll make a quick stop (Yeah)
I shop one stop, I'm high for seven days (High for seven days)
Who is that lil' nigga icy hoppin' out a Wraith? (Hoppin' out a Wraith?)
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade (Chop)
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page (Poppin' on your page)
Trust me, we could never be the same (Never be the same)
You know I like to flirt, no skirts in Turks (Yeah)
I'm puttin' in work, I beat her out the frame (Beat her out the frame, Wheezy outta here)
She sweet, I was movin' off a Perc'
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake (Birthday cake)
Line his ass up like a barber do the fade (Barber do the fade)
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes
Cash told me, ""Wait, it's a billion on the way"" (Billion on the way)

Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate

Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead

Did this by myself, so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the West, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sendin' shots, they sendin' shots, on road, I never see them

Fan mail came to the crib from a yute that loves me, I swear that touched me
I never even drive no whips I own, so they all look way too dusty
If me and Gallest go St. Michael, the gyal come way too fussy, crushy
Man said they would do this and that, but the man wasn't really that wassi, was he?
Nah, nah, nah, the man wasn't really that what?
One-nine-four-two hits my system, man get way too frosty, buzzy
Girls from the past that lost me love me

Everything come full circle, word to the boss above me
Slow stroking 'cause the bamski way too big, my gyal don't rush me

Don't make me have to rise my rifle
Man try send some young boys for me, don't make me have to ride by high school
Shit you man been droppin' lately, don't make me have to fly my iTunes

I asked your bitch if I could bum a cig
She said she got a Kool, I said, ""that's cool""
I don't give a shit what kind of cigarette that you prefer to smoke
I needed a reason to talk to you
Girl, it's true, what it do?
You making Ruby drool
Yeah, $lick slapped me across my face
Snapped me right back in my place
What the fuck? My pace sure lacks an ace
I'm such a slave to my old ways, make no mistake
All of these hoes want Ruby 'cause of the cherry
Fuck her pussy, I wanna be buried, bitch
[Verse 2: $LICK SLOTH]
She wanna be my girl and ride with me
She wanna creep up in the night with me
Blowin' up my phone like ""$lick, I love you""
I'm too detached, I don't feel nothing for her
I might relapse and put these drugs above you
I might just snap and kill another for you
You see? It's dangerous when I think of her, when I think of us
When I think of love, think about my ex, think about the rest
None of them hoes used to give a fuck
Call Ruby up, ""get the Uzi, bruh""
I'm so sick of these hoes, light up the joe
Bury her in the grave I dug
Did it all in the name of love, in the name of love
In the name of love, ayy

Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

[Verse 1: ZillaKami]
I got two feet in a rabbit hole (Okay)
And my dead body in the catacombs (Wassup?)
When I come back to say daddy's home (Huh?)
Family don't recognize my face (Haha)
And if they run up I give them a taste (Okay)
Of anger that's pent up, frustration and hate (Wassup?)
I live in a tundra that fire erased (Huh?)
'Cause why live a life that's mothafuckin' safe? (Haha)
Now, don't understand where my homies at
Or even if they ever existed (What?)
Got some tendencies of the Zodiac
I can see through small little glimpses (What?)
Feelin' like every day I wear a mask
So I tattoo what I think I look like (What?)
Might need demon horns and a switchblade
And a pitchfork and a pocket knife (Okay)

They make you die 'cause you hide what you feel inside
You cannot cry so your highs are your lowest times
They minimize ya, they minimize ya
They minimize ya, they minimize ya

[Verse 2: IDK]
I'm a minus
Sign on the screen 'til they click on me
'Til I can't breathe, they want sinus
My enemies got clique energy
Most can't see who are honest
They want silence, they want quiet
They don't want me grindin'
They rather see me grip iron and start firin'
And have a nigga momma cryin' 'cause he dyin'
They want the ambulance sirens to start flyin'
They want me in jail, they want me in Hell
They want a nigga never excel
They want me to take the test but they want me to fail
They want me to cry
They want a nigga, want me to die, they want me to hide
They want a nigga wanted for crime
One at a time, I want a nigga head 'til he dead
Then I head to the feds like I'm 6ix9ine

That there's no fuckin' recollection when your birth begins
And there's nobody there to hold you when the pain begins
But there's somebody there to fold you when you're cavin' in

Brand new bitch, I don't need her
Oh I'm trash? Why you begging for a feature?
I think niggas gone need a plan B
’Cause I come too hard through the speakers
Wait, panoramic roof in the whip
Pop out the cut, let it rip
On my Ps and Qs, Ion slip
Never kiss that bitch up on her lips
Whole lotta shit went left
Had to get right by myself
Spent about 5 on my waist
But these little niggas ’bout to make me take off my belt
Got a whole lotta Benjis
Bitches on my dick sitting pretty
Think you fucking with me, you silly
Age 18 bought a E-350
Now my wrist real frozen like Disney
Bitch, yo, please, I can't take no pictures
No, I can't follow back on Twitter
But look, I'ma hit that pussy with a favorite
And I'ma leave it with a retweet to my niggas
Aye, really spent a rack on my wrist
Aye, I'ma watch these niggas throw a fit
You in love with her?

Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done
[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?
Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome (Woo,) to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify (Testify,) for the best is I (Best is I)
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die
[Chorus]
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)

If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch

Anything you need, you can find it at the market

[Verse 2]
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home

Niggas don't want war, I'm a martian with an army of Spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite, I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got 'em niggas P.E. nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate, though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Y'all collect pesos, your money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they Lightyear, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit, time to inaugurate
My P.E. conglomerates, 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty, congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora
My heart go, ""ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom""
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raised that 'K
Like every day in every way, and everywhere you go just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say to you is, ""Pray""
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and catch you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle, you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like, ""You're so right""
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

It's like 6 milli' ways to die, my nigga, choose one
Doomsday comin', start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell 'em that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire, 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author, I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, I been the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons, homie, that's an A-bomb
Ugh, fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', ""Fuck censorship!""
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys 'bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the bloodshed
'Cause nowadays for respect, you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzis 'cause it's given to 'em

Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder
[Verse 1]
It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
""Golf"" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche

Uh… time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse, crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much,"" you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth

I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you, I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that
[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

Gorgeous, chrome-plated horse whip
Home, making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating, crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking-new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D onto all available open mics
Smoke it right, proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe, tch
The former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed, so the role was switched
Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tracks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin’, bitch?

Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the dead painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

[Chorus 1]
Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age
[Verse 2]
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

[Chorus 2]
Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

[Interlude]
(Little dark age, little dark age)
(Little dark age, little dark age)…

[Chorus 3]
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing
All alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

[Verse 4]
Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

[Chorus 2]
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed

Every girl is different but they all acting the same
Smoke another blunt and say it tuck it either way

A gunfight and they come to cut the mixmaster

Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare

It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like ""Aye, aye, captain""

And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got ""Ooh, Lord""s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fuck type of message that sends to the fiends?
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian

Ten to one he sees ya through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, ""What's the big deal?""
Spun wheels of steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have it bald or Avacor
Have it your way, or grab his drawer, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney ho's
Lonely, like cheese and balogna only
I could've broke my ""sacro-philly-ac""
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine, milli black
Listen to it go ""bang!"" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who teach slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla, and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors
And get duller than a bake roll with no butter
The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
""He not white"" ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
They can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry
Lying on their first birth, and couldn't even hurt a Smurf-berry
Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off the cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
There's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate
Can all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens
In the name of King Geedorah!
Don't make him catch a seizure

Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke

Lend sympathy to limp-wrist Simple Simon rhymin' emcees

These little titties' abilities riddle me, middle C (Ahhhh!)
Mmm, give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot bod, heartthrob
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet, Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet
[Bridge]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

Look, there's Doom now!
I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him
That's right! You'll never stop me!

I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

[Verse 1]
To riches from rags, I just believed in myself and somehow, I made it out the block (Woah)
I hit the road, I spend a .20 clip minimum every time I wanna shop
High out my mind, I might just go buy another pair of some shit I already got (Woah)
I'm gettin' bags, I'm right in the middle of quarantine, made ten million on the dot
Rick Owen pants, my right pocket full of them Xans, I know that I said I would stop
Man with the plan, I told 'em, ""Just follow my lead"", and I took my whole team to the top
Don't check the tag and I don't check the receipt, if I see it, I want it, I cop
Shoutout GB's, I got some connections in Queens, I gеt my J's before they drop
[Chorus]
Whеre do I start? All of my albums on charts, all of my cars push-to-start
I had no hope, I was just broke as a joke, I go shoppin' and I fill my cart
You wouldn't believe me, I just been takin' it easy, pockets, they sloppy, they cheesy
Made me feel guilty for all this shit I'm receivin', your actions lookin' deceivin'
Beverly Hills, I told her to stay where my suite is, told her the entry is keyless
I'm gettin' paid to go on the mic and I feel like Mic' Jackson when she let me beat it
Feel like a champ, I got them Louis V pants, and they come with the permanent creases
Look at my feet, I got on them Travis Scott dunks, I got friends and them family pieces

[Verse 2]
I make the plan, then they gon' hop out the van and take you for whatever you got
My bitch is tan, I'm on a yacht out in Cabo, got villas that take up the block
When I get geeked, fuck around, tell her I love her, but I really use her for sex
Let her be free, I ain't 'bout catchin' no feelings, I'm catchin' a flight on a jet
She try to leave me, no, I'm not takin' it easy, fuck on her friend, she upset
Knew I was smart, my teachers ain't think I'd achieve, give a fuck about passin' the test
They wanna be me, million in diamonds, believe me, got rings, I could buy a Patek
Opps lookin' dusty, I got some demons, so trust me, keepin' my foot on they neck

Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view,"" waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like ""boing!"" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy
[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC

I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say

One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer

Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business

Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level

Ayo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum, close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
[Verse 1]
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
Saying, electromagnetic field, it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slid into the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U's was pure Brita water filter juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again, but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

[Verse 2]
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got getback, connects wetback, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her, ""No credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gack""
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

Wanna listen esoterics if you looking forward
And you just found the one who's next
Loud music, mad cheese, hella bitches, liquor pouring
Got some museum gold on deck
No stress—
No sweat—
Is he foreign, not a nigga, just fresh just chill

[Verse 1]
Swag on a mil
If you think that you got me with back in the corner-
My nigga go gag on a pill
All-black cloak
And formally threaded and furing some all-black twill
Jeans and the team carry all-black still, no joke
Smoke so much dope-
If a nigga was a fishie I bet I'd have all-black gills-
And I still got bitches in the back seat
I ain't even got a fuckin' back seat
Sayin' that you saw me at the track meet
I ain't never go to the track meets, boy
I was at home making mad beats
Now my beats fatter than the fat beach (oi)
Doing shows in other countries-
Getting dough in other countries-
Back and forth so much you'd think I've been deployed
Just a nigga from the art scene
You can bet that my chick hella artsy
You can tell that we live in the star stream
So you can bet that we live at the party
Fuck, I'm feeling barfy
Mad zoot, hella drunk this a malarkey
No clue where I'm going but it's far, B
With a foreign crew, got your boo in a car seat

Went from bowl—
After bowl—
To bowl
Where did they ball?
Where did they see?
I'm used to smoking all the pain away
Now I'm scraping resin from a bong I ain't used in some months
Just cruising up the coast
All these niggas think I boast
Really getting it and I just need a brew and some blunts
Belly dancing bitches in some all-black
Getting heavy while I'm hitting it
She think I'm bruising her cunt
I'm the truth no comfort (I'm the truth no comf-)
Need proof that you run shit
Do what it do and she do it for numbers
Dude got the juice but the juice got some chunks in
Don't fuck with you 'cause your crew ain't nothing
And my crew kinda something
Infused with these basses, the moon is my conscience
In tune with the waves and I loom on the starships
Still got the juice but the juice in the lunch bin
No truce, straight warfare
Witches with me still got zoot with the munchkins
Trees mad dank, need more
AR seeing 50 shades of the blue next Monday
User invasive, I'm losing
Consciousness fuck what you say got two pairs of Huaraches
Ones I can skate and a pair I can walk in

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry, ask the dumb hottie
Masked, pump-shotty—somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties, he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimy limey, slimy— try me blimey!
Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow 'em like throwing Rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste, there's more cats to chase—
Dogs, he got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying, ""Please make me a dub""
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone...
Cowboy
[Interlude: MF DOOM]
[Applause]
No, no, no, no enough
[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Goony goo-goo, loony cuckoo
Like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue, but who knew
The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a tracklist in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in it for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him ""spike the punch""
Curses, he's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy

Sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying
They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent
Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come
The villains

I got this girl and she wants me to duke her

No matter what I need her to do, she be like ""Super!""
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring ""Super!""
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, ""Niggas ain't about shit""
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ""Super!""
Look like a black wookiee when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off ""All in the Same Gang""
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ""Super!""
See most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the""Super!""
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be""Super!""
Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the ""Super!""
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag, never let her fry the Ragu
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying ""dag boo""
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll duke her
And be a father to your child like the ""Super!""
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em, ""Take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel

If I'm a boy or a girl

[Verse 4]
Oh I'm just a kid
I'm afraid of the dark
But I'm obsessed with ideas
One day I'll go far

Oh I'm no longer a kid
And everything has changed
There's nothing in my heart
And lightning in my brain

(Just because I love you) Yeah, yeah
(Just because I love you) Ayy

[Verse 1]
Peel in my second whip
Stealing, putting second hand kills in my residence
Healed all my brethren with a seal, we can't let you in
Medicine
I put the effort in to still burn that effigy
Odorous, I'm sober, just as lil' as they letting me
Mama, wipe your tears, I'm fighting titans, can't invite you here
Poetic license veering from the mic, my chest too tight to steer
Chess lessons, bloodletting, flood when the night is clear
I ain't give a fuck 'til my lungs had to fight for air
Glaring, staring numb, therapist had a light to spare
Snatched me by the eye, said I'ma fight whether I like or not
And she told me reasons why, but that's the private part
Burnt the midnight lighter
Killed the drive in me to tie the knot
My game stop, but if I name-dropped you, you still got my heart
Driving off
Squeezing off the E-brake
These days, I can't talk to God just for my knees' sake
Long conversations to be had
Wrong places, wrong times, and strong patience I must add
Soul weighted, don't mistake expatiations for some sadness
Strong face, a long race, I'm unafraid to come in last
Quarter tank and ounce of gas and I'm driving
And it's just because I (Love you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Just because I love you)
[Verse 2]
Look, I'm back at it, Glad bags and flatbacks ,a packrat
A crass habit crash flashing, scratch that, I'm past rapping
I'ma show off in a scar competition
Flaunting close calls when you cook, you can't regress back to the store-bought
I hope you keepin' me in mind, I hope you shakin'
I hope you still analyzin' hard as I made you
As hard as I make it love that I'm armed with broad and it's brazen
Arguing with mom 'cause I'm always gone when I stay here
Yeah, she said, ""It's just because I love you
That I see you out here poisoning yourself and want it for you
And I love you better than I love myself, my fruit is spoiled
And it's not a game, I put it in your name, I kinda told you""
And I nodded, I took it to the bank and I deposit
And I dropped it, I looked into the mirror said, ""Omavi
You coarser and you closer to the rhythm that's inside
And I warped you in the interest of design
It's just because I love you""

Clasp the windows to my soul

Mind sifting, tides shift, it's still cement around my toes
Saran wrap around my pack, I can't trust get hand to hand
Served with a hand behind my back
They prayed for us
Ain't heard the answer but my glance is in the stash
It's growing handsome by the stack, I self-aggrandized in the past
But now the sun talking
Not sure of where I'm going, but I'm blunt-walking in life
Or in this hood, so keep a look for 911 callers
I fund loss 'cause I'm from loss
If you gut me, then no love lost
You spun me into crumbles, fingers numbing from the blood loss
I've endured
The moral of my story is I'm impure
The horror in my story is I've been through it and I still do it
And my pencil is in earnest
The difference 'tween you hearing the new records from my service
The medicine I'm burning turned my breath into a furnace
Whole face hot
Shoulders hold weight 'til I break pace and can't stop
So, baby, I could change your life if you let me
Tryna eat, ain't really crave a bite since gained insight from Desi
So I stay inside away from light
Hoping that your prayers reach
Loathing that I can't breathe
Croaking when I can't speak
Was open with my grand scheme
You was either with me or in my way, plow through standees
We sprouting, now we plant seeds
You plant love, love will grow
You plant fear, fear will grow
If you planted me, then me would grow
But I was branded negro
I got slighted before, relegated to pre-show
I started with wine, then to the clear, then to the Nino
And then to Everclear and never steering without pre-rolls
And I just had the presets to preceptor me, bro
I bleed presence and preach lessons, all for free, too
And I offer free smoke to any nigga behind a #MeToo

I've bespoke and I've reproached the Lord, still tryna find bruh
I done got some crazy ass results from showing kindness
Let the sun talk in love with light aubade bathing me

There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worse bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off, ended it and dipped
And if you spoke us off, we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw— no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think, I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...

Death be back, try to lax pain in my eyes
Payin' tax, getting back under fire, stay alive
When you're safe, hit me back
When you're safe, hit me back
I'll wait 'til you there, wait 'til you there
Wait 'til you there, calling with me
Blood like the water from the sky dripping

Slow, slow, falling, slow

Throw you in the water
Fallin', slow
Turn your life to a martyr (Standin')
Starin' at red and blue lights
Blood-purple skies
In the waves, in the wake
Learn to swim, learn to sink (Fallin', slow)
Scream out, reach out
To be held, to be hurt
Wind cries turnt to rain

Man
Lost my dawg to the staircase, took the highest spot on the podium
Ghostin' niggas, probably smokin' to the thought of knowin' us
They loss a part of growin' up
Spurned us, learned I had to keep a wedge to get out of the rough
Fuses clipped for nuisance, disrespect 'cause we carried enough
I promised I'd bury the grudge, preparing the carrion grub
Larry Oops, I was lost in the alley, in the air but not sunk
I spun 'til the lost of my grandmama buried the dunk
Send 'bout a prayer a month, through the above
Niggas moody but imbued with the funk
Better shit to do than play with food
The rhyming Rubik's for fun
But I do what I want, ayy
And I rue what it was later, a looter as such
Confusingly up with paper
I'm shootin' ones with the judge if he sentence my brother
Been with him, muzzled us from the cradle
So we goin' to the grave with this shit
If we join the second line
The ancestors'll hand us a drum to load the second time
Somethin' scary 'bout airin' out the shit I compressed
The fare gettin' fairer now, the cost is
An arm, leg, an arm, leg, and a head
In all bread, the conquest for text, I'm pawnin' the rest
My Bompton partner spawn when donning the red
I'm all on they neck 'til my car park is pardoning French
Spar with a few niggas, sparkin' at the larger percentage
What's alternate when the losses come as often as wins?
And imposter clique thick
Don't got a job, I only ball off pick-six
I'm fraught with friction, in July, we had shit lit as Christmas
Hollins been sensed niggas been lyin', but we ain't gon' mention
Boo hit the stu' and started sweating', told her this the kitchen
You knew the rules
And we knew how to shoot the loopholes, jugo, beaucoup loot
And my kin and 'nem got the cannon, you gon' juke or boogaloo?
I been spinnin' around the answer
Non-definitive, I just crammed it
Outward gifted, inward feel damned
I took my lumps, my bruises, grooves
What the fuck are you to do?
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'
Harry Potter with the Dub-D's
Magic hands, nigga, what cheese?
Had a chance, didn't crush me
We gon' get it by all means
Rest in peace to my Ras G
Raw Fruit in the box, seeds
Let go, then I got wings
I'm seein' red, I'ma charge
You seein' red 'cause you salty
I keep the tears out my mind reach
I put my fears in a box like a prayer that you won't read
Spirited Away the whole thing
Peerin' away, I won't leave
See you starin' into old beefs
Ticket booths where they told me
Thickest thorns on the roses
Pistons roarin' like I'm Rasheed
Pistons roarin' like I'm Ben Wallace
Pistons roarin' like Chauncey
Fill up somethin'  'cause I been drivin'

Smile at the past when I see it

You look close, you could really see your past on repeat
Tracin' every step back like I'm draggin' my feet
You should get to know me

She blow a kiss, it hit the side of my cheek, I wipe it off
Lipstick probably still on my skin
I'm just a victim in this world full of sin

Mama try and keep me safe
When I was eatin' from your beak, I knew I'd grow to fly away

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite

Personal opinion don't amount to what our God say
Tell the kids, ""Go farther,"" when they house don't have a padre
Bottle water when I rap, grew up never drinkin' from the tap
I was so sick of these airports 'til COVID hit the map
Now we're too sleep at this point, we even tired of takin' naps
I lost close friends to a drug binge, in hopes I can bring 'em back
Momma said this the revelation, doubters all lookin' for resolutions
Everyone buying in desperation
On a good note, there's no air pollution
Man, our reflection is over the seven seas

Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors
The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip
Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit
Locksmith of hip-hop, appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time, make trees, take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket, savage with bad habits
Broke, serving fiends, got rich, became a addict
Ain't it funny how it happens, who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?
Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering

Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud

Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies

Pedal to the metal
Lost footin', it was sugar in my gas tank
My cushion was a bosom on bad days
It's not a black woman I can't thank
You called crying when I told you these the last days
It's all mine, could've split the last plate
Niggas didn't have faith, so I stopped tryin'
Apologize, and we outta time
Please get ya alibi straight, you ain't gotta lie
Shook tradition, did it my way
No sense in looking in the sky
Trace elements meddle with minds
Mind-state live, fissures and fires
Niggas with live ammunitions in the stick on the highway
I only get better with time
That's what my mom say
To dodge Satan, say to kill him this time, oy vey
Well here I go, foot on the line
What's mine, what good is it if it's not, you shook a bit
Sookie, sookie niggas wasn't shit
Face looking like I stumbled out of a pit, hundred dollar chip
I piss problems out, the bottle empty
Mama said she used to see my father in me
Said I was not offended
Press, King, Navy, Med, MIKE on the bench
Living life like a nigga put a price on my head
Bless, this how we on it
If you need it and I want it, better come prepared

Search inside my purse to buy something worthless

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
99 problems all gone in that one joint
And that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the contra, ""Phantom of the Opera""
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe-tagged, don't gag, spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger
I'm a manger-born puppy, holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit scabies and bet
The label don't like me, but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
Y'all niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss

I'm couch-drunk and ready to fuck, count fetti and bucks
Pack loud as that slap 'cross the belly
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? I'm at the deli
Scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush, screaming, ""Saddle up!""
Like, ""Fuck is beef?"" Get your cattle cut, pansy
If them fans only local, why them flights transatlanti'ed up?
The rice and the patties cooked nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us
Snapchatting panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
I'm high and polite 'cause po-lice is in back of us
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially
Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep

Why they mad at Lucki? I'm a bodeine lover
My fans worry ‘bout my health so I ain't sippin' in public
Momma told me ‘bout myself, so I can't listen to nothing
I need grandma picture with me, I won’t sip if she near me
I can’t give a bitch the glory, this bitch think she a Britney
I got bitches on my story mad at me, but who isn't?
So she hit me with “What?”, you saw Sawbuck with who?

Coming down the mountain

I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes
Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how you look

Same old shit, just another day
I was in my head, feelin' dead, feelin' microwaved
I was on the strip with the kids playin' Simon Says
Tyron jumped a bridge, would you do the same?
Same old shit, just another day
I was in my head, feelin' dead, feelin' microwaved
I was on the strip with the kids playin' Simon Says
Tyron jumped a bridge, would you do the same?

[Verse 1]
It always rains when it's sunny, never have too much money
Always had the bum knee, you will always be chubby
If you suck in your tummy, when you're starin' at the mirror
In your eyes you kill the flicker, serial killer
What's a sandwich to a dinner? What's a feather to a mattress?
What's a Punto to a Bimmer? What's an actor with no actress?
What's a bedroom to a mansion? What's a bullet with no handgun?
We want 'em all until we have them, happier with rations
Stone skimmers, day dreamers
Nitpickers, misleaders mistreat us even though they need us
Ike, Tina's fight sequence
My demons pry feelings, die dreaming, no glass ceiling
Try peelin' back layers to find meaning
Revealing what you're given is all you're needing
Try breathing, you might find freedom
Instead of squeezing up your buttocks tryna hold ya shit in
[Chorus]
Same old shit, just another day (You know what I mean, shitbag)
I was in my head, feelin' dead, feelin' microwaved (Fucking shitbag)
I was on the strip with the kids playin' Simon Says
Tyron jumped a bridge, would you do the same?
Same old shit, just another day
I was in my head, feelin' dead, feelin' microwaved (Sweet one)
I was on the strip with the kids playin' Simon Says
Tyron jumped a bridge, would you do the same? (NHS, this one's for the NHS, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Jack the lad, only happy when they clap (NHS)
Good with the bad, I'm happy being sad
Say less, why you stressed?
Thinkin' what's next gonna make you depressed
All the best shit's got scratches on the surface
What's a flight without turbulence?
A life without circumstance? Boxing without another stance?
Country with no coat of arms? Estate with no dogs that bark?
A club with no cunts who laugh at people tryna have a laugh?
What's life if we all get along? No people tryna do you wrong?
What's knickers without frilly thongs?
Good music without silly songs?
Abusers with no sober mums?
Screaming, say you're doing wrong
What's love without hate and stuff? Loyalty without no trust?
Rick without Morty? Lil Wayne without codeine?
A rapper without jewellery? Real person, surely

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, ""It's on me—put it on my tab, kid""
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, ""Get off it,"" and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
""To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain"" — take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
""How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, ""What you doing, G?""
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!""
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out — one, two, three — no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and ""Everybody on the floor!""
A whole string of jobs like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store
[Skit 1]
There, it is done
Now that the representative from South Africa has been
Mind programmed
All of the world leaders on earth are under my control
And when they meet tomorrow in special session
I, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World
My plan is foolproof, but just in case
And what about snow?

[Outro: Skit 2]
Now you keep your eyes open
When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
Uh, ladies und gentlemen
I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
That I must warn you, I, I
You must listen
Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over

DOOM, gosh, I wish I’d brought my autograph book
(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head
You’re weird
Why is everyone staring at us?
(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
Relax masseur, just do your thing

None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them

Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again

Had to come in at dark 'cause the big shorties act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing

But the CPD getting new recruitment

Backwoods if you want to catch the sky
Perfect mowed lawns, architecture, no flaws
Just a calm, safe neighborhood, tucked behind the mall

How did you know? It's what I've always wanted
You know I always wanted to be the best
Could never have too many of these
You know I always wanted to be God
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
This is real talk
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?
It's Lil B, yeah
[Verse 1]
My new name is Based God, ice cream paint job
Only come out in the dim lights: vampire
Shouts out to A.E. for riding in that 6-0
Move fast, stick slow, think fast, talk slow
Dude try to play me, I’m leaving with his bitch bro
Sorry for the cuss words, fuck that, curse more
Bruh did things should've been in the Hearse fo'
Now I'm spittin' rap shit, gave me somethin' to live fo'
Hit him with the P-9, bet it'll make his ribs show
Rap game is too fake, real niggas lay low
Word around town that you livin' with a halo
Bet I got killers puttin' cash on Halo
No Xbox, shouts out to Tune, baby
Free Tune, baby, free Rocky, bitch
Free Rocky, free Rocky, bitch
Free Tune baby, bitch, free
Feel me, yuh

[Verse 2]
Bruh think I'm gay cause I'm grindin' in my tiny pants
Bet I'm the only goon nigga in these tiny pants
Sending off shots, kickback make your wrist jam
Fully-loaded thing on my arm like a wristband
You don't want the Space Jam, you're better off to vacate
No, it's no template to touch this, 6 Kiss, reckless
Hands around your neck like a necklace
Leave him screwed and chopped, have him thinking he in Texas

Welcome to my world, like I said I been ready

Finally realized, who's the rawest rapper?
(Yes) Lil B

[Verse 3]
Just cause you a rich rapper don't really mean shit
I'll come to your crib and clear that whole bitch out
And then blow the swish out, my mouth put the stick out
I can't be high and robbing pussies with my dick out
I guess I'm a show-off, take my raincoat off
I'm so wet that a pussy get mad at me
Switch cars, new colors, call it raspberry
Got my own website with the dotcom
Take it out the bag, over stove like Top Ramen
I don't sell coke, my niggas look out for me
They ain't wanna let me fall off the (balcony)

And what's wrong with you, this is hip-hop
This that '09 shit, I call it Based World

I said I call it Basedworld
You know what I mean
So just to tell you, it's a wrap
To anybody that thought they had it
You need to think again
Throw your hands up, it's Lil B for Lil Boss
I need all the Based energy I can

[Verse 4]
Yeah, is this what you really want, you got me in the flesh now
No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out
Rap transparent, my see-through glasses
It's incoherent, and no I'm not staring
I just see through you
And from your heartbeat you are soft in the middle
I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside
Chopper in the trunk, leave em soaked like a wet slide
It's apartheid, rap game is my shit
I'm so sick, I'm feeling so nauseous
Somebody tell the Earth I'm the best now
Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out
Somebody tell the trees I'm here now
Somebody tell the world I'm Based now
See me in outer space, I'm out of reach today

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I seen a bad lil jawn with a cute lil figure
I might just hit her (hmm)
True say man I heard she's nuts but she came all sweet
That's something like Snickers
I might slide to the rave, dip quick with a couple odd guys
That's something like pick up (skrr, skrr)
Drink slow or the liq' might hit, nah, you won't feel sick
But you might get hiccups (ah)
See the packs that we got hit core so you might hit floor
Like your doing up sit-ups
Cross board like you doing up chess
But we still hit goals no ball no kick-ups (never)
If your guy wanna talk off the gums
Cause he's making up crumbs then he might get flick up (flick)
Got food over here on mans table
Fix your face and posture, sit up
I was out on my grind last night (last night)
Pain upon both my shoulders
Had no friends tryna back on site (who's there)
Magic up in my shoes when I did 10 toes
Man, I flew like Mike (wash)
I ain't tryna say I'm an astronaut
But I'm tryna tell you that I'm fly (fly)
Long story short I'm the best man here
So why would you pick that guy? (why?)
Cah you think he's thug? (oh yeah?)
Check out my flex, man I shine
But I still look rough because I came out the mud
Stil-Still made sure that my team had love
I was in church tryna get blessed up
When your man left town tryna sell gyal love
I was OT just tryna get paid
When your man stayed home tryna get some love
[Chorus]
Round and round
Them man were just going around
I-I was tryna bring us up
Bare man was tryna take us down
We stay out the crowd
Couldn't really care 'bout town
We were all uptown, tryna make up pounds
I been about, now they loving my sound

[Verse 2]
You think I was finished?
Had to make bread out of town overseas
How could you think that I'd stay home chilling?
Gotta kill games on something like villain
Br-Bro wanna say that my flex come dead
When I saw mans check, man, I thought I'd bill him
Shown man a check of the date, just watch

[Verse 1]
I'm that same old brudda with the steez (Ice, ice, ice)
In the Baped-out fit, got a shark on the hood of my top and a ape on my tee (Ice, ice, ice)
Been a min since I linked with the bro, said, ""Link up soon, let's talk over tea""
These days it's all about flex and talk but, bro, I'm tryna make this P
I got a text from the bro in Cali' tellin' me, sit tight, he's gonna make me a beat (Two secs, two secs)
In a gaff with a stylish babe on a stylish date, tryna make me a treat
She tryna talk 'bout Rovers, it's over, I'm tryna bag this dream (On God)
Two secs, let me take this call, I gotta skeet real soon, tryna pattern this G
It's been OT nights, bit far from the den, tryna get big checks and the cash flow steep
A couple boys on the block
Man, the feds been lappin' on locals and socials, man, it's lookin' all hot
Tell the yutes just stay off the violence and make P's don't worry 'bout crops
I'm just keepin' it real, man, you know my deal, trust me, big word to my pops
[Chorus]
In the yard in the ends with the broski, man, you know me, I'm takin' champagne shots
Don't talk like you know my ting when you're 'round my ting, I'll send you to the shops
My bro just came uptown with the latest trends and a few odd cops
In a vintage whip just glidin', stay slidin' in a coupe drop-top
(Skrr, skrr, skrr) Ayy

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, I got tea no Tetley, wait
Tell me why you never come check me
You tell me that I'm way too spendy, wait, babes, I'm just too flexy
I got eyes on my chest, that's Fendi (Flex)
Step to a high-class rave with a glass in my hand and I'm still in a tech fleece (Flex)
My bro got a coupe, that's a Bentley (Mmm)
Money come nice, get plenty
Got a foreign little baddie in the crew with the face caked up, but you know that's Fenty (Mmm)
Took a snap in the E-class coupe now she tryna ask who's pickin' up in the Benzy (Skrr)
Come off that flex, man, I'm not tryna flirt, man, you know I'm just friendly
These times, man, I might rock the Loubs on my way to her crib so she know I step pricey
Her old man left like a weirdo, I'm a hero, man, he ain't nothin' like me
Can't force my flex at the function, do it nicely, be subtle, man, lightly (Light)
Got my game back in like '010 but, man, YG's, I'm in love with the '90s
Don't show me no stripes my bro, man, that's not like me, only step in the Nike's (These checks)
True say my bro got a check but I said ""'Lowe it, man, let's spend that wisely""

Unless it came with a pool and a gate

Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
4 for 4 Wendy's get her a plate

I peeped the code was non-existent, watched these niggas squeal
I'm sick of holding my tongue for y'all fucking feelings
Don't need the toxic, I just want me something I can feel, you feel? (Yeah)
It's like it's my thoughts still trapped up in my head (Uh, yeah)
A lone wolf on this trail, it's redveil, I maneuver through the fake to the bread
Fake nigga flesh gon' fill up with lead
I gеt the check, then I don't spеnd it, I just flip it instead, my nigga (Yeah)
I got a lot of steps to take, for now I'm tryna breathe (Uh)
Good girl, she won't complain if she taste my seed (Nah)
No, these niggas not my bleed (No), it's 50/50 with you niggas
Peep the grass, these shitty blades that I'm tryna weed
Uh, shitty blade of grass, yeah
I stomp it out and then I get the cash, nigga
Then I get the cash, nigga, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
I stomp it out and then I get the cash, nigga
[Verse 2: Cameron Bolden]
Starry nights like these got me lookin' at the Moon
Thinkin' 'bout how when I left, I said I'd come home soon
And now I'm home and I just hate it, I wonder if it's fated
I was only born to fade in, what's the cost of what you makin'?
No stress, two breath, one step, what do you regret?
Tell me how you feel, you don't look upset
What did you forget, me? Shit, well I forget a ton
And the past a couple, so I tossed it all so I could run late (Fuck)
That was dumb (Shit), be back inside by sundown
Got a couple fans of me, but still ain't got no funds now
Don't play this when you high, only play this on the comedown
Lost my elevation chasin' fame, what do what I want now?
I rap about myself too much, feel like I'm so conceited
My broken body on the pavement, we still undefeated
You know the way it goes, you know the way it gotta be
Keep roses in my toes and some pain inside my heart, it seems
No matter where we go, I end up right back where I oughta be (Where I oughta be)
Life a odyssey, baby, you oughta see it (Hahaha)

Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
""That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar""

'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, ""Get out the way""
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
""We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter""
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down

Yeah... another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a woo, like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball but I'm still glad I hit it
Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know, the coulda shoulda type
Like ""Oh, it was slight too tight, come on, I would've piped
But our schedules contradicted we're always tied down""
Ay pipe down, the first night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown and, pulled out the slinky
She screamed ""Joey spank me!"", and after that she even thanked me
Swanky, one time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kicking rhymes 'til the end of time
But back to the topic, oh yeah, I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off and wondering why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga, do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off, and my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do?
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent them postcards, so you know it's true
I promised that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus?
Screaming, ""Daddy, stop it"", ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polishing in the scratches on my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my Cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came?
I hit that spot twice, and since then you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name but my first impression, ""What a lame""
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot, six months, and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track, but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear, I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic, and it’s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back, sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears

Doing bong hits, on the roof in the west coast

Glad that we win a tad fat, in a bad hat for men

I'm everybody's favorite plug, with no me they out of sockets
Got clients that's on probation, say the drugs too good to drop it
That's they problem. Yeah that's they problem
I keep 'em hooked and hungover, I'm the drug dealing closet
They short with cash and beg for soft passes, ain't lobbing
They love me. They quit and come right back, they Brett Favre-ing
Better stop it. They better stop it
Cause if they leave I get a better cheesehead like Aaron Rodgers
Check my posture, I'm too straight to get robbed or caught by the cops
So all these setting me up, snitching on me rumors better stop
If pockets wet enough, I come clean the job up with druggie mops
No I'm no goofy, no pushing me around, my buggy locked, uh
I probably come off as selfish and OC
But this my show, they buy the ticket, so I give 'em the nosebleeds and shit
Long as they keep copping and telling their homies
I'm like a desk in math class: they can count on me

So that one Black bitch? She beat her addiction, pray for a relapse
Got offended by the first count on me and then went to rehab
That's my fault, she say ""You tweeking, people shouldn't know what I'm into
I'm your patient anyway, thought our sessions were confidential""
But fuck that bitch, know I'm serving if you call
But anyways I'm back to moving them packs like U-Haul
As matter fact, think the junkies love me just as much as packs
It's probably that, druggies keep 'em rolling, pray they never crap, uh
And if they nice, 12 for 32 like rulers
That's why I gotta keep my eyes open like pervs in Hooters
No tricks up they sleeves, I give 'em vests, don't let 'em fool you
They gotta learn to count on me like grade schoolers
And if they nice, 12 for 32 like rulers

And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

And saw it through without exemption

Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 3]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

Now what you want? Hot shit to the death
How do you like this sound? Exactly what I meant
Looptroop is hotness for Babylon intruders
Gun salute shooters & everyday music consumers
You can't bruise us, better chew that paper
Talk shit, we a go slew the perpetrators
We heard you hate us, we hurt you fakers
It takes more than your jealous ass to break us
This shit is pumpin' wrecking your sound detector
After twenty records still top choice for selectors
In every sector all over the tour
We bring an all out war on all of your laws
We go all out raw all over your domain
The whole world know these four, who knows your name?
We leavin' stains on your parliaments
Then go to the next sold out show, who want arguments?
[Chorus]
Don't hate the player, don't hate the game
Hate the Troop man we take all blame
That you got no money, you got no fame
That you got no honeys, you got no name
Don't hate the player, don't hate the game
Hate the Troop man we take all blame
That you got no money, you got no fame
That you got no honeys, you got no name

[Verse Two]
Lace up your sneakers, show off with your speakers
Now, raise up your glass, make sure it's twelve centilitres
Blao, salute the dj when the crowd's off the meters
Aaoh, let's make it hot, tank tops and wife beaters
Yo, go tell your women I'm an asshole, I don't care
No, I don't get lucky, that's skill, life's unfair
Ohh, I know it hurts to see the girls, see the gear
So, you gotta let it out on somebody in here
True, I understand, I make you look bad in your hometown
Fool, but I'm a leave tomorrow, you'll get back that torn crown
Cool, swallow your pride, get up here, gimme a false pound
Boo, tough on your ego, but it's rough to be small time
Ok, two can play that game, I'll shake your hand and smile, fuck it
Say, nothing man, I'm working in my high so cut it
Hey, I know the best thing we could do is stay above it
Ha ha, you must hate the Troop as much as I love it!

Yo I'm bringin' the monstafunk your baby mom's a pump
The ladies' hearts a thump, your neighbours´ cars a bump
This shit till they cause a roadblock for four blocks
You say call the riot squad! I say poor cops!
They don't know what they're in for
They won't come prepared they didn't get the right info
...mation, no bio, no presentation
Well here it is man - the proper education
The lowdown on the whole sound
Hope you're good at taking notes cus I won't slow down, check it!
Looptroop is the textbook example:
You can't fuck with beats, texts, hooks and samples
A classic before it even hits the plastic
But can they do it again? No need to ask it
You know we bring it from the heart every time
You know you need to press start then rewind
Or you might miss a vital part of the rhyme
Cus that's just the type of thought we design
So Looptroop is still hated by everyone
Cus Looptroop is still better than anyone... what!?

Don't hate the player, don't hate the game

Still won’t tell her that I miss her
Swear I need that lil kiss with the squeal with it
We be hanging in the dark
We surprise 'em with the prowess
If it ain't to give a spark we’d be still hidden
Prone to languish in my scars
Waste away when I’m at Howard
School a break and rip apart a whole lil village
I can’t pace it with this art
Scraped a project off the bottom
Made a painting of my heart with a lil filter
I keep cadence with my heart
Still alive defying logic
Cost a payment up to God with a lil interest

We were sixteen, this means robbing was an option
Money was the problem, scrapping copper for some profit
Break it in for some gin, hope your mom don't got a problem
Throw the bottle over the fence, and I hope nobody saw us
We were gone, we were dead, resurrect and go to bed
Just some dirty white boys with some drugs up in our hands
Never slanging dope, no, cause we'd rather just smoke
Ice cold, back roads, tires covered in snow
I'm taking it back to the basics, I'm bringing it back to the basement
See this that Christmas light shining, hundred one blunts to the face, shit
See I was fifteen, drinking like I was fucking thirty-two
All the things you and your friends do, I did that too
Broken glass, blunt ash, dashing away with the product
Peep it, flip it for some dollars, then we buy some more bottles
Our parents thinking that we missing, haven't spoken some weeks
My shoes wet from the weather, hiding out from the heat

I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick, and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap, and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub' deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like, closet niggas, masc-type?
""Why don't you take that mask off?"" That's the thought I had last night
""Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' your heart
I wanna know what made you stay when it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin' when you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to share
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world, so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted to recognize who was there, yeah

No, fuck that, nigga, I got you
Fuck that

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs
(Bitch-ass niggas!)
[Hook 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon
Niggas know that it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

50k for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah, the misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts

Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hop that shot your woman down
I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sorе
I thought I was her daddy but she had five morе

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hop into that district court

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground

This ain't a modest way of livin', I ain't hungry

The last one

[Verse 1]
Sick as a pig, can you help?
Tryna get a grip, fingers slip then I melt
Sittin' in a pit, only me and myself
I can't deal with the screams, only screamin' at myself (Ah)
Tryna protect so I project
Deflect and they call it self-defence
Feel the pressure and we all got our reasons
Smile on the out, but inside I keep bleedin'
Fun and games 'til you gotta take the blame
And I said it was me 'cause I'd do it for my mates
Then again, would they say the same?
And it's all tongue-in-cheek, tryna sweep out the fakes
Love never felt real, the wheels won't brake
They can't see the tears through the raindrops
Tough lad and I always put a face on
Told me already that leopards can't change spots
[Chorus]

Goodbye, my only decision

[Verse 2]
Overthink, sink in my seat
Eat, sleep, repeat, what you know about T?
Smoke weed only way I fall asleep
Same routine, drink 'til I can't speak
Slave to the progress
I obsess 'cause I ain't got control yet
I'm tryna fly but my wings feel broken
An eagle encaged in a closure
Lowest of lows, decomposing, I'm sober, loner
I can't be alone, why I always pick the phone up?
I beg you pick the phone up
(Beg you pick the phone up)

You see I'm wise beyond my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear

So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ain't shit
Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in ""The Matrix""
But fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of ""Blueprints"" and ""Illmatics""

The toe box in them Jordans to fill ain't big as the mayor seat
Often I be embarrassed over how brazen I be
But it beats bein' embarrassed over how lazy they be
I locked myself in this lil' cage so they ain't me

Identify with Aang, last of a clade 'cause we the same, shit
This that crushed Volkswagen door because I always lose when I gain shit
Took the total to the face, my frame ain't cave in, thankful
Ain't nothing but a little character what that pain prove
This that love from a awkward angle
Cracks in my family like ceramics and commandments, too
But if you touch my chain, you'll perish like Thor hammer, too
Mjölnir, niggas with different charges stayin' static-proof
Been doing this shit way before the money, ain't got that to lose

Lost in this path on my only
Stress and depression cost a pack of the OG

I peep destruction in discussion over earl tea

Always on my hand like a pick to guitar strings
I ain't seen bliss, it's been a long ting
I'm too busy tripping 'ddicted to the wrong things

I'm like ""What's the word with you, sir?""
You just moss on a tree, I'm not concerned with you
I leave the curb when I'm crossing the street

A half ounce in 'em, another half ounce in my fleece
And on account of this, go ‘head and count me out of this

I'm dodging county, it's a thousand degrees
It's back alley shit, my nigga, look
My eyes wide open, I'm sleepy, I'm on a highway

A bubble and a Skully when traveling through the Tri-state
And trouble play the gun, hear it clap and it make my mind race

Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""
[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

[Verse 2]
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan

Thinking to myself
I don't wanna kick back and I don't wanna get help
Man that shit's so ill
If I pop another pill I might end my career
Though it's not what it appear, take a look up in the mirror
I wouldn't change a thing
I ain't tryna interfere, I been living too fast
Fall back and hang
Sipping on purple Tang
My life's in double motion
Feel it through the words I sing
Smoke looking like a locomotive
Kill 'em all I don't need no motive
Blowin' up, rollin' up explosives
Living life like fear and loathing
I been through it all, celebrate I'm toasting
Take another sniff, I have to admit that it got me feeling good
Like Tony when he tripped
I ain't even tripping yet, think I need another hit
Mushroom kicking in, I'ma see some other shit
Shit
I be on some other piff
In a Audi S4, blowing smoke behind no tint
Shit
Dangerous as it gets
Like I got high once and I ain't been back since
Shit
Evidence of my wins, evidence of my sins
I know where it all begins
Just hope it's better in the end

I can smoke this pain away
While prescriptions eat away at my soul

Double G buckle tucked under my shirt
I taste codeine when I burp
I bought a Bentley, forgot it insured
You just a broke boy, you get on my nerves
What would I do if the music ain't work?
If I turn my trap phone on, will it still chirp?
I couldn't tell nouns from a verb
But I could sell wings to a bird
I could sell tags to a shirt
Askin' me if you got tickets for sure
I don't know, I'm not sure
You just got hit with the curve
I didn't know that girl was yours
Said that she don't got no boyfriend, but sure
I grabbed that ass, and she call me a perv'
Opened her legs, so I had to insert
Make my own beats, and I write my own words
Cash found a diamond tucked under the dirt
I blew my third check and second and first
Now I stack up, pay my bills on the first
Me and Body goin' half on the chicken
First we sell it, then we splittin' the difference
I don't got no time to waste on no bitches
'Cause I know that the sea got lots of fishes

Smokin' and stackin' and countin' up green
I think I need me a money machine
I heard some fuckboys were plottin' on me
Waist 32, .40 tucked in my jeans

Neck full of water, it dripped on my shirt
Nobody fuckin' with XO for sure
Your label's new artist is really a nerd
Suit my bitch up, yeah, I bought her a fur
Shootin' shit up, better act like you hurt
Before I tell, I'ma go to jail first
Drivin' on Xannies, I might hit the curb
Valentino on my shoes and my shirt
She ain't want me back when I wanted her
I'm from the Rex', but the Southside my turf
Had to think twice when I ordered dessert

And hate runs through my blood
Well, my tongue was in love
But my heart was left above
I've got to be leaving now
I thought I'd never be shot down
But, girl, I'm black and blue
So beaten down for you
Well, I'm beaten down and blue

Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away
[Verse 2]
And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well, I had no chance to get away
I can't escape my own escape
Even more when it's sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh, but girl, just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well, take my crown again
He's submerged in doubt

[Verse 3]
But wait, I make my last request
See, this could be the best
But, blue, I need to rest
See, I been broken down

She dropped a load on me before they closed the door
I be with nobody who know what's goin' on inside
My father body swollen behind my eyes
I ain't cried for him in time, the return solar
We on the ride forward, the reverse not workin'
Sometimes we collide, the black sky full of supernovas
And stars that died, no lie, I'm still rootin' for us
Two foots in the soil (Right)
Rhymes forged to conjoin us to the cosmic
Spliff burnin' like crude oil, cool water drip like osmosis
I'll set the mood for ya, you know the vibes
Today I got time for it (Today I got time cuz) run, Forrest
Five on me like I'm Bob Horry for the tribe, slime
Mamba mentality, stars falling out of the sky, Sly
[Interlude: Little Richard]
He was a star, when he, when I got him, he was a star
Sly told ya that everybody is a star
The only problem is some people haven't been put in the dipper
And poured back on the world
That's what the answer is

[Verse 2: billy woods]
Woke up on the West Coast for the first time in my life
Drove cross country, but I remember those flights
Genuflected when I heard the weed price
White boys with the weed pipes
Sunny days, sunny nights, mighty clouds of Northern Lights
I was always bright, so no sooner than we touched down
I'm seeing how we could get home and be right
It's hard to live in the moment but I guess I had a gift
Hawaiian so potent, zonin' off bong rips
I painted houses all summer, they paid by the shift
My boss was an enterprisin' white kid
Eagle-eyed everything you did—shit gig, but I didn't quit
MJG and 8Ball spittin' out the whip, spliffs with kief at the tip
It felt sleepy at night, but I liked that, felt like you could relax
Like you could disappear like I wasn't surrounded by the past
Months passed and we goin' back
And in the back of my mind, the plan already hatched
The door panels already stashed
Illinois State Trooper just waiting for time and space
To cross our path

Group calisthenics in morning fog
Catskill views, cats still yawnin'
A few hundred miles from hot garbage and smog
'89 fine, Air Max 90, first run, fresh lungs, sweet blood
Light bugs spark blackness, back of the annex
Past bedtime kissin', prayin' nobody catch us, zapped
Baby powder homey sock if you fell asleep first
Pummel body, la-di-da
Batteries added, vicious cycle, hurt people, hurt people
Days of summer carefree, haven't found an equal
We all knew the Isleys before the Beatles
Red moon over the rec room in direction of discovery
Idle time wonderin'
Thumbin' 70s Ebony mags, drippin' red ICEE on the pages
Learned to swim in a pool where a boy drowned last year
Wax in my ear
I heard voices I couldn't make out in the deep end
When I dipped my head under—come again?
Burrs stuck to my socks

Mosh through the orchestra pit, the ripped CD-R skip
You hope the CDS don't stick, bent over dope-sick
Too scared to write the book, took it, put it in the hook
Of a song, no one listened to it, looks like I wasn't wrong
Hid it where they wouldn't look, lookin' like Zedong
Lookin' at Taiwan like, ""Look, they shook, let's get it on""
Shots whizzed, his depression was all gone
Emotional liftin', please use the proper form
Bend at the knee, rolled up half of Guam
Lost no sleep over the fate of your white farm
What goes come back around
So when they came for me, I wasn't alarmed
Get fished out the hole like Saddam
Tough guys, won't go alive, get found unarmed
An object in motion stays in motion, I wait 'til the sea calm
Slaves like hammered bronze, ships was yea-long
It's too late for qualms with the hammer in the palm
You a slave to the hammer, you do what it wants
Take the good with the bad, fly trees in a cheap blunt
Niggas put up a good front, but you can see the zipper
Before he took a hit, I watched the nigga shiver
That that Bill Withers
Nigga had the nerve to say, ""You can't take it with you""
Fuck would I want with any of this shit? Dummy

Everybody wants to know if you comin', but they won't say the words

Hangin' from a chandelier in Babylon
We don't believe in white gods, they gettin' rattled on
Been in the belly of the kingdom, you can't tag along
Unless you got war on the mind, to get the shackles off
You can't ignore the karma when it's flames across your lawn
We checkin' corners, so make sure our lanes don't come across
See, word from Marvin, couldn't sue me from ""What's Goin' On""
Movin' through the system, sprintin' through a marathon
We don't get second chance
And they don't need a reason now, so I don't let 'em plan
When I been fighting for the truth, I bring some extra hands
Cement inside my gloves to knock this shit into the fan
Put that on everything I love, it's been a minute, had to flip
It's in my blood to be a stack, had to handle other business
Ain't no riddles, it's a fact
If you see me and my energy ain't really tryna chat
That's them generations chargin' the battery in my back
See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors
Body just a vessel, brain tapped into the answers
Tried to see me on the CCTV, couldn't scan 'em
Like the serial was scratched off on the barrel of the branding
I been ten toes down with the city on my shoulders
You got no idea how that weight could make you colder
Screamin', ""Free my niggas,"" 'til they free, it's never over
Spirit said, ""It's time for me to really be a soldier now""

[Verse 1]
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left eighty racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

And right now I don't know what to do with you

I'm tired, I need an escape
It's hard to relate to me
Straight out the bottle, no chasing it
Look in my eyes, I'm a space cadet
Just a matter of time, I'm embracing death
Dead pool, you should place a bet
I'm in the bowels of war
But I feel no stress when I let it pour
But it all come back when I can't run back
Anything that even happened the night before
Always gonna fall on the sharpest sword
Always gonna sleep on the hardest floor
You can still see light in the darkest corner
But you still feel lost when it's unexplored
So I'mma see black till my eyes adjust
Till my time is up, till my mind is fucked
Limp around town on the Irish crutch
With a belly full of whisky and self-disgust
Peekin' at my own dead body through splayed hands
As I grunt and I drool like a caveman
Fucked up, I'm a fool
With a room with a view of a wasteland

Ruby stay at home on a Friday night
Hoes blow up my phone, tell 'em that I'm quite alright
I might forget that my pimp game is weak sometimes
And if you slip you fall in love—now she gone
Now I gotta ball, flex on Adderall
Sex on Tramadol, I guess I'll try 'em all
As I recollect, the records I collect
Most of the artists wished for an early death
I will give it my all, yes, I will give it my best
Anything to replace all the static in my chest
But I know she won't be home, I feel so fucking broke
I'm lethal, I bleed foam, and seep smoke

Everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him
Would sink into the swamp
Hi
And the same time, elsewhere in fantasia
A creature of darkness also began his quest

[Verse 1: Navy Blue & Earl Sweatshirt]
Depths of the man that I was from the start
Stay next to the fam, got a place in my heart, chest
Breath on demand
The rest of the plan got scrapped when I landed, invested in arts
I do less when I stretch 'fore I hit the bar
Pull up, Tan Cress' on the shoulder of the coat of arms
Told you we the best 'til we good and gone
Yeah, love shared it was both ours
The same prayer like more dark
Blood in the water when I go to wash
Life sweet when you know the cost
Thousand-yard stare, I was looking sauced
Smoker's cough, ash in the air
Not scared when we send 'em off
That's life, black plight, can't get along
Not alone
[Interlude: Rare 4 Sample]
But there might be one chant

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt & Navy Blue, The Neverending Story Sample]
Tandem remarks, who the fuck playing like the brand isn't strong?
And the globe cold, that the feral hands sitting on
My ass in the throne
We running these checks and balances, on fam
Check sits, dashes at home (I want to go to Africa)
Hard work, callous the palm, that isn't wrong
Soul battered and grown, sadness is gone

[Outro: The Neverending Story Sample, Sun Ra, Unknown Sample]
Everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him
Would sink into the swamp
It's the music of the earth
The music of the sun, and the stars
The music of yourself, vibrating
Yes, you’re music too
You’re all instruments
Everyone's supposed to be playing their part
In this vast arkestry of the cosmos

[Verse 2]
""I haven't stopped crying
My father's been drinking
I need a place to stay
I don't want to be here
He's saying the words that
He promised he would never say
That liquid he consumes
Makes him speak the truth""
[Chorus 1]
And I said, ""No, It's not that at all
It's that bottle of lies for a troubled heart
It's standing on the edge of a mountain top
Screaming anything he wants like
""Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Because I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist""

[Verse 3]
I remember the way you shook
It's a shame that we're not soul mates
Because if I didn't know better
I'd say this feels pretty good
And how could I be scared
When I stretch and feel you're there
So shut your mouth
Because these words will speak themselves
I can feel them in these blankets
And they're surrounding your figure
Embraced in the quilts
And I can't help but think
You're my missing puzzle piece

[Bridge]
I wake up in the hallway, I'm looking for sunlight
With the rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
Ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
To get out of this house
I can't make them stop
I'm just like my mom
You might also like[Chorus 2]
And you said, ""No, these demons will fall
You're so precious to us all""
And I said, ""I, I can't do this alone
I still need you to hold
So don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid""12Embed"

Lil B for lil' boss, big talk, get your head cracked
I'm from the hood, niggas terrorists with no Arabs
Westside gangsta connected to the mob
Connected to the Roc like I'm J Cole
Shoot like I'm Steve Nash, 4-5 tucked with my weed stash
You fucking with a robber ex-dealer, get your knees cracked
Internet got you thinking that you is a God
Real hip-hop over here, blood and tears over here
No bitch over here, bad bitches over here
No pussy over there, pump it up, you a queer
Tryna diss me when you got a fuckin' full beard
Sit down old man, your back 'bout to blow out
My rap like a gold mine, studyin' my dope rhymes
Rawest rapper in the game, it's like I'm sniffing coke lines
Losin' all your hair, Joe, think you need Rogaine
Joe Budden, Joe Booty, what the fuck is yo' name?
Shut the fuck up with those depressin' ass songs
It's the summer time, get some fuckin' pussy and go home
Pump it up, pump it up? Man, I'm finna fuck your bitch, Joey
Bitch, I'm Based God, I should write you a fuckin' hit, Joey
Leave your fuckin' head holey, the clip got the rubber grip
Lil B for Lil Boss, I'm still screamin' ""Fuck A Bitch""

Spit like I'm 65, eating pussy 69
You're a nasty old man probably getting butt-fucked
You run around, Karate Kid, where's your fucking nunchucks?
Maybe you don't have none because you in the hood still
Probably sellin' X pills, probably eatin' asshole
Recording all your bitches, you a motherfuckin' pervert

See me in 3D, I'm young but I'm ready, jack
I dare you to comeback, I won 'cause I am rap
Rap like Saran wrap, your model bitches saved you
Put him on the internet 'cause don't nobody play you
Performing at cafes, you're still underground
How you go mainstream and run back underground?
Joe Budden, you're a clown, please just forgive me
You shoulda followed fans, now your ass is gonna be history
Make you an example, I feed your ass samples
You're my own son that ain't never made it rapping
I tried to give you chances, you didn't take my handout
And now you looking stupid as you did when you came out
And you ain't have no swag and you ain't have no cash

And go make a mixtape and mope over every song
Keep recording girlfriends, bet you still jack off

Who gave a say to the boys in blue?
Ain’t shit changed but the choice of the noose
I’ll be the voice of truth in it’s absence
I was with Jordan in his room sippin absinthe
Y’all was tellin stories in the booth on some rap shit
Real rap, shit is pitiful
I’m still mad at that nigga Cruz catch you lackin might spit at you
I’ve lived life trying to please the world now i’m done with that
I’m cutting back
Life wouldn’t be worth it if I wasn’t black
Life wouldn’t be perfect without love attached to it for real
I was working till the sun left the moon in the PM
I was hurting when my blood ain’t come through when i need em
I left June as a demon
My bread blue when I leave it out
Niggas true when you feed em
Till you lose and you grieving
They’ll take the spoon and go eat with it
I know who my peoples is in the end
They put in they 50 cents and turn into many men
I’m learning from them regrets my burdens was heavy then
Men in red, Kenny Jet Smith
Set the pick for me, victory what the rest is
Bless

Who gives permission to love more than usual?
I know my burdens were to pitiful to carry round
I know they’ll bury me deep in the ground
It’ll carry me home one day
I know one day i’ll be there with you
One day, with you

I iced out my vatos, I'm really up (Yeah)
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz, and my Bentley next (Skrrt)
Don't play around on my phone, ho, give me sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now, strap your bullet vest
Five-hundred fifties, six-hundred hundreds
Seven-hundreds twenties, let's get straight to it
Eight-hundred tens, what's that, eight bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands, let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you, so if he steal, it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans, make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat, secure the bag, nigga, ah
Uh, oh, a bag secured, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags (Yeah)
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit, like, fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin' (Nah)
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic (Crazy)
Chop with the laser, get decapitated (Grrah)
Can't smoke, I'm on papers, hold on, this my Jamaican (Love one)
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, ""I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby"" (Hmm)
Well shit, bro, let me get her then (Yeah)
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den (Gang)

Now it's over, you've taken your life
Dark grows thin and left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now we're both dead and so scared of the black
This life of games and diligent trust
It's the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever end to dust25Embed"

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time, but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hopin' you would let it go and you did

Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

[Verse 2]
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home31Embed"

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, “Well, how did I get here?”

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

And you may ask yourself, “How do I work this?”
And you may ask yourself, “Where is that large automobile?”
And you may tell yourself, “This is not my beautiful house”

It's the same person from way back
Silked out with the shades black
Play the blocks where they blaze at, sprayed at
Maybach like a German car
Consistently with currency, forever earnin' pa
I spit this shit for all my people that's gone
Whether they locked up or dead, I bring 'em life in this song
Back in the world with me
Takin' flicks, countin' this cake
The fuckin' Gucci store got my foot covered in snake (uhh)
Tryin' to see a billion, rockin' reptilian
Y'all hear the shit I talk and question if it's really him
The way I'm extra make y'all regular like Psyllium
Williein' with the best of 'em, lookin' fresh with 'em
Stand up, quick to man up, y'all pumpin' estrogen
We built different, I'm a premium edition
I get driven around, y'all put the key in the ignition
Comin' from Queens to flip a key is a tradition
[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, live from Jupiter
Uhh
Still in the after hours with the coke heads that rock Pro Keds
Been a criminal since I would duck officer Lopez
Before Feds was snatchin' my mans up in handcuffs
Now we look back and just breeze, pumpin' pop at your trucks
Eatin' high quality fish chunks from Masa
Breakin' bread, writin' blueprints on how to prosper
Florida, Hollywood, Hollywood, L.A
I just wanna go coast to coast and sell yay (sell yay)
The hustle is my heritage
The struggle seen in my eyes presents the evidence
Bruno Magli suede covers my footsteps
Never fold, never told, one of those good reps
I got that post where they cop at
Pop at your top hat, nigga you not that, I'm ill
You know the resume, only rock exotic gear
Egyptian musk on, smellin' like Islamic prayer

[Verse 3: Conway]
Look, dutches pack with the best flowers
You niggas got settlement money, we finessed ours
You blow your money on the strippers, we invest ours
Put it on your head, have you killed within the next hour (Goodnight!)
I know homie gon' be sick (ha!)
I got no album out, still a Rollie on my wrist
He could be mad as he want, but I know he won't do shit
And if the nigga bust a move, I'ma make sure he don't exist
We sippin' on gold bottles by the caseload (uh huh)
Lawyer money make the charges disappear, where that case go?
Whoa, we got shooters on the payroll
They whackin' everything if I say so (brrrrrrrrrrr!)

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...57Embed"

I don't know how it ends, I can't see it in the distance
But can you ever reach the end of a timeless existence?

[Chorus]
I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
I'll fly under no conditions
Teach myself complete submission
While I grant myself complete permission
[Verse 1]
Just imagine being human, hating your confusion
Denying 'til it's proven, laughing at illusion
Thinking institution's the solution
While tyranny and irony float in its pollution
Imagine reducing yourself to your name
Janet, you've got no one else you can blame
You've stuck all your conscience inside of your brain
So, now you just shoot stuff inside of your veins
So go ahead and find your meaning
With your methamphetamine
And once you can see that you've trapped all your grace
Maybe you'll join me and, girl, we can race
‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎
[Chorus]
I can run faster with no wind resistance

All white like I'm Mensa, (Mensa) I got Teezy in my Swisher (Teezy)

Got two of everything, two watches, two chains, and two pistols
Not just two pistols, two clips, too, extendos longer than pencils
Fuck you mean? (What?)
I go hard for my team
Boy, fuck you thought?
Nigga, I rock designer, shorty, this shit cost (No, no) I don't know what the fuck you bought
So you not from over there, but you over there?
You getting whacked, give a fuck if you the law (Boom, boom)
I done turned into a savage, this the shit I got taught
All I hang with is killers, I ain't never got caught
My squad go crazy
I'm with Shotty Go Crazy (Go crazy)
And on the B.O.S, Folks crazy, he be totin' the .380 (Boom, boom)
I dare a nigga try to play me, I'ma lay his ass down like he lazy (Boom, boom)
Bitch, I ain't for none (None)
They put a nigga on parole, see I couldn't walk around with no guns (What) boy, you can ask bro 'nem
He'll tell you 'bout Foe 'nem, and how them niggas see me and they run
'Cause they know I got it on me ('Cause they know)
And I can merch on my homie, I'm used to ridin' 'round by my lonely
But Sheen just called, say he wanna ride with me
So I put him in the back, let him tote that Macaroni
And that bitch go brr-latt!
Semi-automatic, it took off a nigga back
I wish a nigga would try to run up on Pap
Hell yeah, I can fight, but I'd rather up a strap
I'd rather up a pole on a nigga
Gotta keep a pole on me, nigga, I'm too known for a nigga
How you get caught for a pole, lil' nigga, and you home already?Lord knows you done told on a nigga
You can catch me on the Pole, where it's cold, you can froze, lil' nigga
Need a sweater or a coat, lil' nigga
No sense of humor, but if you walk around broke, lil' nigga, I'll laugh at that joke lil' nigga, with yo' funny ass

Boy, I gave your bitch back, shorty, let that shit go
Yeah, I let her suck my dick, but I let that bitch know, ""Hell yeah I got a bitch"", so I let my bitch know
'Cause it's level to this shit, rules, regulations, she give me dumb brain like she never had no education
You ain't tryna kill nothin', boy I see you hesitating
Shootin' with your eyes closed, fuck you doing? Meditating?

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Had a drink about an hour ago
Sitting in the corner by herself, in a bar in downtown Hell
She heard a noise, and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes
A double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said, ""Wait a minute, I have to think""
He said, ""That's fine, may I please buy you a drink?""
One drink turned into three, or four
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
""Now, babe, the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?""
And she said, ""If we could only please be on our way
I would not run""
That's when things got out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
She didn't want to
He had his way
She said, ""Let's Go""
He said, ""No Way!""

[Chorus]
""Come on, babe, it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on, baby, don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid""

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said, ""Now, baby, don't be sad
In my opinion, you weren't half-bad""
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on, party people, won't you listen to me?
Date rape stylee
The next day, she went to her drawer
Looked up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge
He screamed, ""She lies, that little slut!""
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
And now his heart is filled with tears
One night in jail, it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

[Pre-Chorus]
The moral of the date rape story:
It does not pay to be drunk and horny

[Chorus]
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

That's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
Take it!

When I was in the seventh grade, I fell in love with a girl
I'm almost 20 years old, and I'm still in love with this girl
I wanna make love like the 80's
I wanna fuck you in your room and make babies
I'd fuck you if you would just let me
I'll fuck you in my new Mercedes
I want you to know I'm the best
Want you to know I'd make your pussy wet
If you lay down on my bed
If you lay down on my bed (Down on my bed)
I'm not fucking with you anyway
Been trying to fuck you since the seventh grade
Bitch, can you tell that I'm high right now?
I don't know if you're my type right now
I fucked you in a dream once
[Verse 1: Louie Dufflebags]
I saw the moonlight on your titties
There is no love in the heart of the city
I fucking dare you, come get me
Danger boys always be with me, there's dangers within me
I think of you getting choked up
Dairy Queen bathroom floor, getting coked up
Give me five minutes and I'll blow my brains out
First you break the pp, then I'll whip the chains out
I'm sneaking inside of your bedroom and telling you
Even though I tried, there's still no forgetting you
I swear to god I thought I would stop loving you
My dick gets hard when I'm near you, I'm fucking you
Are you fucking with me?
I'ma fuck you like it's 2003
I'ma fuck you like I did in my dream
I'ma fuck you like I did in my dream

I've been thinking 'bout you since forever (Forever)

I was away, I was the one for the longest
My dick is the strongest, I'd die for my squadron
My only question is, where are you now?
Awake in the night with this blade in my mouth
And this hate in my scalp

[Intro]
I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up the schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
How I'm 'posed to act when my morals ain't respected?
How you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
What's next? War and turbulence, prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same
[Verse 1]
Trademark on that pussy, trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
Yеah, duh, hol' up, blood, hol' up, cuh, hol' up, sis, huh (Hol' up)
LLC the Glock and I LLC my bitch, huh (LLC)
Pass me the rock, I go crazy on my kicks, huh
Had to tеll my grandma, ""Sit back, relax"" and shit, huh (Make nigga)
Make nigga buy her house and car, she's off the list, huh
Fake nigga, talkin' 'bout he rich but barely is, huh
Eight figures, jumpin' off the stage into the kids, huh (Yeah)
Single out the shooter, take the shooter to the blitz, huh (Yeah)
Droppin' out of school, dropped deposit on their crib, huh (Yeah)
Poppin' out on Instagram, I only post my bitch, huh
I don't need your input, get your two cents off my pic, huh
Generation money, type of money dyin' rich
And I wanna say, ""Shoutout to the dead, now I flex,"" woah

[Chorus]
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (One)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you niggas not taking a risk
I'm taking advantage and taking my course (Kill 'em)
I cannot compete with the mud in my system
My tolerance low, I don't tolerate force
I protect, I am the one
I rose up for the score
I gotta let my ego go
You niggas not ready to settle the war (Yeah)
You niggas not ready to stop bein' hoes
You niggas not ready to open the doors
You niggas run in, take off with the drawer
You niggas not really the richest on Forbes
You niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices

I took the 'Lac then hopped on the flight
I cannot look towards your jaded advice
I took the torch, I quit being nice
I took the torch, now I gotta fight
You niggas impulsive, quick to make moves
You're biting your flows, a big appetite
I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white
You gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
I don't move in silence, this shit is abrupt
I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
Young nigga know the hustle and the Ps
Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things
I was in uncle crib at fourteen
Can't get through to mama 'cause she'd rather drink
Facin' eviction by the thirteenth

And I don't give a fuck what you saying or what you doing
I don't give a fuck if you praying or if you looting
You can have the gun in your hand, but you ain't shooting
Fucking faggot
Much respect to my niggas
Rip a pair of Nikes, cut a check for my niggas
Uhh, the gun on my side like a good goomah
Bitch I pull up to the hood in a good new car
Chase the gin with the ale, that's ginger ale
Tanqueray and Heineken, I'm high again
Pretty Dominican bitches with rapsy voices
Say facts to everything when I rap, facts

You funky bitch you (uh huh)
Holla at me when you see me, nigga
What up? Woooo!!!

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Suede overcoat, champagne scriptures
Life fixtures that ignite pictures, my life whispers
Success, but stress is still present
Like the presence of a pleasant when he begging
I disassociate with niggas who associate
With clown niggas who be fronting like they holding weight
When things fall apart they was usually never together
Queens in this bitch, I'll be rocking leather forever
3 quarter waist length or the trench
Out the coupe, on the stoop, off the bench
Really I'm live, I'm trying to live
Fuck trying to survive, it's a big different
Started selling coke, now I got white privilege
Crunch math, get the right digits
My life pivots, like I'm posted in the paint with possession
Only moving in a forward direction
Anyone can get it if it's hammer time
Pop ya block, hit the stage at the Hammerstein
Right after, it's nothing, it never happened

You be with the boys and I'ma be with the dawgs
Blood on the Travies, it serve as a challenge coin
I'm the voice, I had to speak for the org, pastor, preacher
Smashed up weed on the organ, master teachings
Actually couldn't hold me (Who's gonna stop me?)
I was hungry
Mama made her son read, so I'm hunting glances 'til the peak
That still didn't feed me
I had to get a feel for the whole thing
Peek in the orbs, speak on what I absorb
Reserved boundariеs, I found a different route to еxplore and run around deep
I told you 'bout the reaching, you found out and screamed, that sound to me like a loss
I had a bad bout with grief and I tossed a match on it
Kerosene, burned the ring down to ashes
And memories, feather feet behind
And ahead of the beat, throwing 'em off
Arriving in the nick of time

Bet I find the way in like I'm Santa
He not an OG, man, that boy a ho-G
What's done in the streets supposed to stay in the streets
Yeah, I used to hit licks and go fuck Dominique
Yeah, booster bae messy, but she keep me neat
This Givenchy and Louis
Who would think we was poor, on the floor watchin' Peter and Stewie?
Word around town, man, them niggas get down
Before we broke a pound, we was savin' up doobies
I used to feel stuck, outta luck with a hole in my Chucks
Sellin' grams, tryna get me a QT
No one around, I felt just like a clown
Lookin' down at the ground with my face looking droopy
Oh, that boy say he can give you the world?
Well, come fuck with me, bae, I'm the universe
Yeah, I like how your diamonds be hittin', but you don't compare
I'm the diamond that's in the dirt
I can go where I'm from, but lil' nigga, you can't
'Cause you really a bitch from the outskirts
When I'm hitting, your bitch, make her outburst
I'm the reason she sayin' her mouth hurt, ugh
She wanna be my queen, Alexander
But I don't go no feelings, no feelings, no feelings
You ain't did shit for a nigga, so like the feds
He act like I don't know niggas, yeah
It's supposed to been you and I, but I ain't sayin' no vowels
'Cause Osh'a never owe niggas
You didn't believe in me, dog, and that hurted my feelings
No crowd, I'ma show niggas
Yeah, I love my lil' daughter, her daddy a bitch nigga
Didn't want to step 'til I stepped in (Ugh)
Yeah, he a fuck nigga, so I call him FN
He gotta get hit with that FN (Hrrt)

Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully

Yeah
Yeah, um
Uh
Ladies and gentlemen
Yeah
Whew, that drip
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the comedown
I'm strung out, noddin' off inside the dugout
[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da (Just a little angel dust)
La-da-da-da (Yeah,) la-da-da-da (Yeah)
La-da-da-da, ayy (It's just a little angel dust)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missin' halo?
She would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow
Found a twenty layin' by the sewer rats
You know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food
Hurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel
And now we at the end of verse two, oh

[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? (Woo!) Tell me what you made of (Yeah)
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial

""Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'?""
""Mm-hmm""
""Well, I confront it all the time. We're teaching people how to use their head. The, uh... point is, that in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think.""

[Verse 1]
If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, ""How do you do?''
I told him, ""I'm losin' my grip""
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

Bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation

A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

Yeah, okay, I
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive

I give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fuckin' own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'ma run it over, I'm a fuckin' soldier
So cold, bruh, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out 'til the night, I'm chillin'
Everybody worried that the lights might kill 'em
Uh, feel ya sight slippin'
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pourin' all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem

When the sun go down, I come alive
'Cause the guns go off in the summertime
The guns go off in the summertime, blaow

And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Gettin' wasted as the time that I'm spendin' high and sedated
I'm puttin' five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashin' lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite 'cause there's niggas that overlooked me
Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fuckin' cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothin' that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to chokin' a pussy, pussy
Sweaty man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighin' sess like it's a lot of options
Fifteen on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches tryna act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, S.T. was the older initials
Bend rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin', I'm so impatient and goin' dumb
As disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashin' out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick

I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me

I lick it at your squadron

Start spitting while I'm driving
Peel off then roll up, you niggas better slow up
Before you bang the fuck out
I aim, let it flame, blow your brains all the fuck out
All over your shirt, since a youngin' I was buck wild
All up in the dirt, ma screaming, ""Get the fuck out!""

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Booted up now
She couldn't even look in my eye, giving me run 'rounds
Sharing sentiment when I'm high, quiet for come down
Fatal look, throwing the royal flush out
Spoils plush, I had to go with deluxe
You had to know we was young
My matrimony to drugs
I'm having a hell of runs
I'm married, fell out of love
With caring about the boy
Staring into the sun
And I'm seeing green, my pedigree on the run
Bleed in them sheets, the funds coming in floods
Need everything all at once
The ebb and flow of the pulse
At the peak and the lulls
Whoever he thought he was
Get tested, I feel the rush
Impression just ended up
Forever in hella love
We took the bus wherever the fetti was
Subtle difference 'tween buzzed and twisted, get hella drunk and mischievous when I want
A fuckin' chemistry ain't enough
Ascending up through the rungs
Pretentions, you try and tuck
Ain't missing 'em from the sum
Your situation is bugged
Heavy surveillance cover your chest with tape in the truck
Bet we ain't saying nothin'
Obey the hush
No time to meditate on whether stay or to run
Whether to spray or duck
Bet they playin' to lose, you bet we played and we won
[Verse 2: Wiki]
Underestimated, always understated
Couldn't understand and couldn't fuckin' take it
Branded and emaciated, stranded in the fuckin' basement
Ugly duckling, but still the chicken heads is clucking
But when I fuck 'em it ain't the same like, ""What's your function?""
No disrespect, but we can't even hold a discussion
I'm disgusted by myself for even tryna rush it
Fuck love, it's myself I need to get in touch with
It's my health I need to get on top of
Covet and fuck the public
I don't need the interruptions
It's interesting how everything that I did is nothing
Compared to what I'm 'bout to come with
Hit 'em up with
Hit they head with concussions
Hit them where it hurt most, when that verse coast it'll crush 'em
High off that Nerds Rope and drunken
Don't need a fur coat to be the flyest in the function
Or the luncheon
I'm fly 'cause I'm fly, you fly 'cause you try, you be frontin'
Dry your eye, whole lot of demons stuck in
Only way to leave them's to confront 'em
Ain't no reason for 'em, that's just life and what it come with

You don't wanna see my Nina when this bitch gets nervous
Bitch my bullets 5G so you get full service
I got real ice, this a real pipe
If this pussy run up on me its a scary sight
I'm shootin' left and right, these bums is out my sight
I run it for my dogs, hit it wrong or hit it right
I got big money talkin', which means yo' bitch stay callin'
She wanna fuck on me, now baby, I'm no second option
I got big diamonds dancin', they on bullshit
But my choppa so big he a nuisance

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Hey, grab the Draco and spin the block

Oh, tell me then, don't lock the door, we belong together

Know that you're broke, I can sign your cast
Did you know you can fight back?
Where do we go when it all goes black?
I can feel your heart through your chest, are you okay?
Just follow my breath, I can numb your pain, I can freeze it

Know that they say that you're wasting your youth
What we really got to lose?

Gotta find a way, gotta find that path
I don't wanna stay, I wanna go back
Back when we had each other
Now we just cannon fodder
Always at the end of the bottle
Hold me while we sink to the bottom
Tell me, do you think we're a problem?
Tell me, do you wish for another?

I don't know
[?]
It's like when you go to read your own poetry, you get all choked up

[Chorus]
Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold
[Verse 1]
Everyone, and friends and family
Saying, “Hey! Get a job!”
“Why do you only do that only?
Why are you so odd?
We don't really like what you do
We don't think anyone ever will
It's a problem that you have
And this problem's made you ill.”

[Chorus]
Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

[Verse 2]
The artist walks alone
Someone says behind his back
“He's got his gall to call himself that!
He doesn't even know where he's at!”
The artist walks among the flowers
Appreciating the sun
He does this all his waking hours
But is it really so wrong?
They sit in front of their TVs
Saying, “Hey! This is fun!”
And they laugh at the artist
Saying, “He doesn't know how to have fun.”
The best things in life are truly free
Singing birds and laughing bees
“You've got me wrong”, says he
“The sun don't shine in your TV”

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind

Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now

Huh

[Verse]
Let me tell a little sad story about this young boy, grew up, no pops in the crib
That nigga momma workin' so she couldn't really show him no love when he was a kid (AyoAA)
He didn't even mean to do that incident
He was only eighteen when he  caught that bid
He in and out of jail, he ain't know how to move
He ain't know how to fight, he ain't know how to lose
He walked in the spot (Spot)
They told him, ""Strip, cough, squat"" (Uh)
The C.O. just told him that this is procedure but he knew in his mind that he was doin' a lot
He had to figure it out and then learn all the rules and then follow them, like it or not
He caught a new charge 'cause he had a little weed
Tryna sneak this shit in, it was right in his sock
Yeah, they had him in intake for like a week
They hate his guts, they think he killed police
They made it super cold with the AC
They ain't give him no blanket, they ain't give him no sheets
They put him in a cell with a dirty ass sink
He couldn't think, he couldn't sleep
They gave him no soap to wash his ass
They ain't give him no toothpaste to brush his teeth (Look)
He ain't know why they keep botherin' him, he was kinda scared, ain't wanna argue with him
Pacin' back and forth, they keep on followin' him
Couldn't take it no more, and he finally hit him (Yeah, look)
The C.O. done hit the button and they come and they helpin' him and run in and crack his ass
He just took a beatin' and unleashed the demon
He lookin' to grillin' and actin' bad
He ain't never been locked up before but he made up his mind
He like, ""Fuck it, if this how it start""
They couldn't count him out 'cause anybody who know lil' homie, know lil' homie got heart
He gon' adapt to his habitat, even if his habitat get dark (Uh)
He was a lil' fish when he jumped in the water
And then he grew into a shark (Then he grew into a shark)
Two years later (Uh), nine fights in, he found his religion
He started workin' out, takin' food, soups and respect 'cause this shit wasn't given
He wanted more for his life, he was sittin' in jail every night and his life wasn't hittin' (Life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't hittin' (His life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't, look (Nah)
Two years, he fought the case and he ain't worry 'bout it
In his mind he knew he ain't losin'
He got a paid lawyer, that's a good lawyer
And that lawyer do know what he doin'
They wanna take it to trial, so he take it to trial
But that little nigga goin' through it (Huh)
He was just holdin' it down for his mans 'cause he wasn't the one that was doin' the shootin' (Bow)
He didn't cop out to this damn lie, call home and found out his man died
He looked up to the sky like, ""Damn, why?""
'Cause he's locked in the cell and he can't slide
All hell break lose when that man cry, you can see the demon in his damn eyes
That nigga a vampire, hah (Bow)
If he want you dead, then it's verified (Bow)
And he went back in his cell and he thought to himself like, ""Damn, I feel a lil' stupid""
He got a big gun in the crib but he's stuck in the jam and he can't even use it
He want a re-trial and take back everything that he said 'cause he know he ain't do it
Lil' homie a real nigga, he done made a decision already and he stickin' to it
Uh, yeah, he stickin' to it, uh

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Bitch, I'm in the black light street 'cause it make sense
If it don't add up, crush it, give it more ent
Come in with the Garbage Pail Kids, we some tyrants
Leave that shit to me, I take 'em out I got a license
Drenched in snow look like blow, blow, blow
Puerto Rican gold just for my nose, nose, nose
Never ending story on the road, road, road
Me and Bladee gon' pop 'em like some toast, toast, toast (Lean)
[Verse 2: Bladee]
It's a movie man, HD, I make it three-peat
Bleed on me like Fiji
I'm trapped in 3D
It's me and Leany, gone, I feel like E.T
Easy, for you it was hard, for me it's easy
I make you see me, 3M, bitch, she geeky
Prada, no CC
Old dog, you can't teach me
Pressure on me, G, play you like a CD
I'm up at 8:30 chasing the feeling

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
Mouth filled with blood, now I got blood on my rug (Lean)
Ten X pills, ten bitches in the tub (Lean)
Meals with my team and you crawling for the crumbs
I was born in the cave, baptized in the mud
Me and the gang in an Uber creepin' up (Skrrt)
Two blunts up and two cups stuffed
I'm done with this city, y'all some rats and some bums
Checks on checks, paper planes, tear it up

[Verse 4: Bladee]
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you, now I'm bloody
I'm not a lover, man, switch that to the other (Ayy)
I'm with Yung Lean, man, that's my fucking brother

World War IV, got the twin towers bustin'
Fuck it, mixin' bleach with my cousin
With the family, we stay loyal like the Russians

[Verse 6: Bladee]
I'm crushing dirty pills up, I need a couple (Dirty pills)
Harry and Meghan, man, show you how much I love it (Much I love it)
I want the trouble, straight pain, don't need a stunt double
Comfortable, middle of the winter, it feel like summer

[Verse 7: Yung Lean]
Hop out, rockin' D&G, haha, we the new KGB
Don't know what you see in me, my wrist laser, no A&P
Hop out rockin' APC, restin' under my cherry tree
My soulmate buy the Burberry, but I be sippin' Hennessy (Hennessy)

[Verse 8: Bladee & Yung Lean]
Red velvet (Velvet, velvet)
I'm selfish (Selfish, selfish)
Ten bands just to go and eat some shellfish (Ten bands)
I felt it, I felt it
We can't go on like Elvis (Presley)

It's after hours at that glamorous night spot
And they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm
It's the life of the party, to think I could've almost died
Lord, help us

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama, please tell her I said, ""Say something""
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh
I heard passing by in a stroller remindin' me, ""Hey, keep rolling""
I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a *****
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later
All that time, y'all thought a ***** was high, thought I was crazy
My mom, she ain't cut no corners
Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life ****
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this:
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were ****
So pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
Sh-sh, ah, ah
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married
Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite, 'twas her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though
[Chorus: Kanye West, The Notorious B.I.G. & Diddy]
Straight from Shibuya, on some zen
We back, ramped up, we on ten
It's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win

Southside gang mentality weigh heavy
I was thinkin' out the box even in a Box Chevy
And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy
'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley (The life of the party)
I ain’t turn in homework for like four months and I bet she let me
She saw the vision
""Yeezy you special, go make your own decisions then""
Man, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce
They tried to take my voice away, I ain't try to take ya choice away
I just prayed the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a slip-up
Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage ya, good Lord
Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with
The paparazzi never really got what my angle is
They treat my married life like some type of entanglement
My neighbor still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't sayin' it
I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit
I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it
God has said himself to make sure that the baby live
And if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this here?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute
Let me stop playing with it, hopped in a Lamb' with it
Hopped in a Lamb' with it, in a damn pandemic

Huh
I'ma need a bigger bag for the cohort
Tryna make a millionaire out of slum dogs
Bet that, head crack, blunt force

Where seven make a three, turn a ten by law
Crescent moon wink, when I blinked it was gone
Left the crib, smacked, no sheath on the sword
Made it by the skin of my teeth, thank God
'03, momma rockin' Liz Claiborne
Had her stressin' up the wall playin' Mary J. songs
Rainy day came, couldn't rinse the stains off
Long way to go, we already came far
Story stayed the same, it was never madе up
Threw me loose changе, look at what I made of it
When the mood change, I'ma poker-face 'em
It's a new day, who got all the aces?
Who be foldin' late? Who know when to play dead?
Who sit up straight when the roof caved in?
Had a full plate, you ain't wanna split it
Tell it to you straight, you ain't wanna listen
Cup runneth over the brim
Bust open, there's no closin' the lid
Drumroll, here go my lil' entrance
Gung ho, I'm the one that go get it
Five O's on me like the Olympics
Pure gold, somethin' told me, ""Don't mix it""
Caught a feelin', momma had me out Temple
Not religious, we was really out Philly
Livin' on the fly tryna wing it
We got us a fire to rekindle
Redirect the fight where it's meant for
Triumph over plight and immense loss
Ride alone at night, I get clear thoughts
Caught a couple slights and I veered off
Saw another height, had my ears poppin'
Walked outside, it was still gorgeous

In the dark inside, we was real hungry
On a seven of the five, we was real hungry

My queen won't feed on milk and honey

She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run

What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Kickflip 'til the rubber on my vans gets thin
No grip
Bitch I'm pushin' with my pants all big
Don't trip
I'm Shy but I really won't take no lip
[Verse 1]
Bubble tea, backpack, on a mission
Told me to relax, but I really couldn't listen
I had an AirPod deeper than Shakespeare in my right ear
My left one's still itchin'
And my tongue hot like kitchen
20 years missing jump shots
Pippen tears on my face when I'm up too early
But deadlines, authorities, they don't concern me
The dark builds intuition skills
Hit the lights like Tron, make the mission 'Kill'
Fuck vision eyes, I have a different build
But if you find my chain, 'ima need it back
18 karat, nah I'm lying it was 20 bucks

Watchin' indie movies is a new identity
I wasn't into it at first but now I genuinely see
The beneficiary, oops
The benefits are the priority
But usually I just use it as a personality trait
Post a picture of me with my grip tape showing at the schoolyard spot

To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
You might also like[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger

Ugh, off the strength, I'm not as numb as I thought
I'm broken links, my circle shrinking smaller
Satellite revolve, my core is a cauldron
Surrendered orbits
Cross-check what's really real and what's performance
Speak for self, but wondering who else really on it
Who's really all in?
(Hello) Trouble calling
My phone don't ping, I'm buzzed, leave me alone
Truth with a stash pocket for a lie
The document is alive, I speak life
Every border gets revised if dissolved
What defines what is charged?
Haven't made up my mind if I'm assigned to the stars
I slide when I want, I'm inside of the funk, trust
She want up when it dump, it came from the sludge
Involuntary, shooting foundations in studs
Tears and snot bubbles, sob puddles
I lay in the wet spot
Listen, let's not conflate, I give what I take
It's the hunt, there is the chase
Some talk like they never got punched in the face
You can't see clearly now, don't come near me
Wails of the weary, loop max infinite
Draw me closer, damn near intimate
[Interlude]
And I'll give you a kiss

The flyer said ""Grown and Sexy""
I came through over-proofing the plastic Pepsi bottle
Security didn't check me
Skipped coat check, they playin' the oldies
I'ma go 'head and get sweaty
Plus saved the ten-piece
It's hell up in Harlem, so meet me 'cross 110th Street
If the tree's a bargain, bars—that don't really tempt me
I'm from where every car foreign
And we drive 'em on empty (Zimbabwe)
Bury me in a borrowed suit
Give my babies my rhyme books, but tell 'em, ""Do you""
Give my enemies the good news: Time flew
We was probably brothers back then like T-R-U
No jerseys, no durags, hard-bottom shoes
Niggas tired of the foolishness
No disrespect, it's a lotta mids in the room
My pack loud, cut right through
Kofi Annan in the booth, Soyinka in the stu'
Sese Seko Mobutu if the DJ play something smooth (Slide on 'em)
It's a move, I don't dance, but maybe tonight, maybe tonight
I don't know her and I don't even mind if it is the strobe light
Live for the living
I made chicken late night in my boxers, burning up the kitchen
She passed out right when I was done fixing
I watch reruns in the dark, fingers and lips glistening

Ooh, get 'em
I'm so damn proud of myself
I did this for you, G, alright?

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Been to there and back, tall tales tossed to the breeze
We keep facts in the midnight wax, family tree sap
Light leak through the leaves on familiar tracks
I know it's real even when I'm feeling bad
Resilient as they built the black
She shimmy into the—yeah, that's consent gettin' established
You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic
Trust the passage rites to life's chapters
I have to write to find balance
This game of telephone massive
I do what I have to with the fragments
The madness method rampant these days, I let the panic pass me
Featherweight, my heart was straight despite baggage
Asymptomatic, but I get sick of the delays—faster, faster
Practicing practice in what I preach, keep pace
The calcium on my teeth fade
Streets are blazed with the anger complacency and deceit create
Ice sheet break, I couldn't weave weight
All I could say to the times that I couldn't freeze-frame, bleak fate
You got so much to bleed to clean-slate (I've got so much of my—)
The bag of tricks in my sleeve breaks
Southpaw under the North Star, forcing all the league changes
(I've got so) Don't sleep late
[Outro]

Dodging destiny, still, that coffin like a bed to me
The voices spoke incessantly, my pride is what they fed to me
Tried to read the messages but words was wrote illegibly

Toxic thought telepathy, living legacy
Rocking weapons like accessories, dying for supremacy
Really we're significant as centipedes
Crawl around the Earth with no identities

I can throw them to the sky if you bitches care to drop it
I'm cocky, switch the topic, chop the rocks up in the projects
Treat your pussies like they're objects, you can never stop the progress
Powder and some vegetables
Trap game exceptional
Commas and some decimals
Leaking out my gastrointestinal
Bitch, I'm a professional
Bitch, I am invincible
X-Men guns, catch me looking like the Sentinel
Flamethrower fire make a player melt
Steady keep the product moving quick like a conveyor belt
You can't save yourself
Praying for your saviors help
I'mma straight flay you and display you on my favorite shelf
Ugly Mane yeah you see the chain
Yeah you see them hoes flock to me say my name
I'm in that Chevy thing slinging banging run the game
You can't even see me fuckboy, we are not the same
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fly (Why's that?)
I got money (Why's that?)
There ain't no slack in my mack
Got guns (Got guns)
Got bread (Got bread)
There ain't no slack in my mack

The fuck you tryna end up in the gossip column?
I know I got jewels like I'm the pharoah of the ghetto
But we are and it's a bright-ass shiny Carerra
Stickin' your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos
Cost a thousand dollars, same as your housing holla
Not to mention the wrist and the thirty thousand collar
Pussy must be good, he's victim to your power
Shit, nigga like me? I would never allow it
Spit that shit to me, I would ask you, ""Have you showered?""
You wanna get up in my boat and ride
Take pictures with the kid up in Ocean Drive
Go to Casa Tua and just sip on Calouas
At the bar, talkin' to other women about the best jewelers
You like that, huh? Smilin' still, call your girlfriend (Why?)
You fell asleep at the wheel

Ayo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest

Shit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist
So what you want – Patron or Petrucia glasses?
Ain't no mystery, his daughter know the history
And every night we toast like it's victory, get with me
And I ain't changed since my early mental
I been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples
No drug to drinkin' – what you want?
No, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon
Never puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn
Back when he pushed beige like it was coupons
With a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names, but they would only do Sean
And I ain't sayin' they regret it, but fuck it, they do
'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga
What would they do, huh?

Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps

How I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib

Except I improve with the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back

How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

[Verse 3]
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?

You make all whites look bad like African history
You make all nights look sad like drunk parents but me
I keep letting you use me for a fucking get up
Somehow I don't know how to stop, it's like a fucking hiccup
Besides the fact of you being a drug addicted hipster
I see past the coke residue and carpet stains of liquor

You make me want to stop trapping, at least until you overdose of your fix
But if that happens, my heart will be broken, so here's your fix
You get me every time with your childhood stories
You use me, I'm in denial, I'm like a father on Maury
I lose a lot, I ignore it
But when I'm broke it's your fault
When my connect call me and tell me no more being short
You'll be gone by then, onto another young dealer
Just hope you pull your cards right cause you might meet the wrong dealer

Everyone I love is gonna die
And I will die as well
I think about this before I sleep
And have since I was a child
In my life, will I make a difference?
In my death, will I be missed?
Will I be granted some sort of an afterlife?
Or will I just cease to exist?
This fear makes me feel so naïve
I wish that I could just accept
But I'm chilled by the redundancy of
Thoughts collected, but not kept
And maybe I'm still a stupid, little boy
Too weak to understand what will come
I want to find peace of mind
Maybe no mind is the answer to that conundrum

Oh, I want pure thoughts in my head

J'bois le sang tout droit sorti de cette corne de chèvre

For a chemical imbalance, you sure know how to ride a train

When someone comes a-knockin' with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you for you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby, some mother held you near

There is no distraction that can make me disappear

Because I've fallen, yes, I've fallen right into the love I've found
Long before I reach one hundred, I'll have fallen to the ground
And for generations, they'll romance us, make us more
Or much less than ever was before, the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution, nothin' we were fighting for

The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

But now we must pack up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves

And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

[Chorus]
But now we must pack up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 3]
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born

Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree

I am 2Pac, 'cause I'm as real as it gets
Keep it real something that I always did
Posted up in the hood with them silver playing cards
Stuck in the game, said I'm realer I beg your pardon
I ride on you suckers, anybody I'm 'bout it 'bout it
My mind is the key, I'ma use it and think about it
Wall to wall catacombs, please leave your daddy home
Stuck in the game, Basedworld we flexing bro
At it so hard, I'm the next to go
Latin in my blood, keep it real like Mexico and Navajo
Keep it real I'm not a ho, he got to go
Playing in the game, they're praying for lawsuits
Sue me, you better have life insurance too
Watch over your body, like them birds do
And pick your ass up off the ground, like bird food
[Verse 2]
Feel like a peasant, trying to find my life again
I stand with grace, with a shield I paper chase
A helmet created by the BasedGod himself
My harvest is the rappers, put the food on the shelf
Everybody want to say that I'm helping myself
When I help the world, bitch help yourself
I'm an only child, I was God's impression
2Pac perfected, outlaw on records
I will never lose the game, my historical effort
This is more than music, collect this message
Basedworld Paradise, man the streets infested
With the happy people, I'ma be invested
Crown me the God, of all the seasons
Watch me or join me, cause you ain't gon' beat me
So stop annoying me, I'm off the wall like rotary
The rap game is more to me, you don't want war with me - Lil B

[Verse 3]
To me Lil Wayne gotta gift
Come to Basedworld Paradise, we don't enlist
We just pick, and we conquer your home
We make you slaves
Rape you for 100 years, then forget the pain
I'ma hide the knowledge, I'ma hide the game
I'ma force the pain, 'til you live the pain
And you hate yourself, cause none remains
Accept the picture, that we all paint
This a joint connection, when I sleep, nobody protecting
Do you get my message? While I'm thinking, stressing
People think depression, I was born with crescents
Speak another language, my message
I'm just another gamble, a genius
This is scriptures seamless, another thesis
I've never bowed to Jesus, but I respect Jesus
All this mind control shit, it got me fucked up
I'm about to expose this
I'm on another level, and you people know this

Lil B, Based God

[Verse]
King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin' with the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe
This a few things that show that I'm the rawest
Spending cash everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding
Want beef, like six I’ll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin', cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention
I fuck with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see rappers, all I'm thinking, ""I'ma get him""
In the booth or in the streets, I'm known to tear and rip 'em
Fifteen and sixteen, eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing, I was living off my system
Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em
B-Town, Waterfront, and I put on for my city
We done did it for six years, just reached twenty
A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see twenty
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking, ""God love me""
Everytime I hit the beat, man, I do it for my Mom
Workin' hard every day, I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil Wayne do
If you up against me, you get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like, just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow, and it just ain't cool
Always jocking on my style and it just ain't you
Only time I feel you is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy, too
I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down, it reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because I'm trapping like a bitch
Like Gucci Mane said, but it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B, you can call me ""king of rap""
I done did a few things and I'm never going back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin' who the man is
Lil B for ""Lil Boss,"" I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses
And I'm into weed, I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Word to the wise, you should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap, 'cause it's the only thing you love

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up

Accurate facts put the black, in fact, if you thought that
You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

My hot head cools to the stone cold touch

I hit zero
As guiltless loveless sins flow
Through me, you threw me
I descend smoothly
My concrete bed beckons
Can you hear me?
I was born in seconds
Do you fear the
Way you steer me
Towards the ground?
No, no, no I was never scared
Pain, had made my vision impaired
But now I'm free of care
See, life isn't fair, then at least death's there
To hold both hands
And stroll through lands
And as it stands
The empty vessel of a man
Can't be moved
It's not the cracks or the grooves
But the pavement soothes
The pavement was soothing
My body wasn't moving

Brain was buried deep beneath the ground
Fears would drown

Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
[Pre-Chorus]
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

He's going the distance

No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine

I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave

Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, ""Bitch, get back in the door""
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it
My, my, my, my, look at little Scotty now
The same fuckers used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade, in the third grade
Can't hide from the truth
Now, we 'bout to go ape, we're 'bout to go ape
These streets is not safe
These niggas ain't playin', these niggas ain't playin', huh?
These niggas ain't playin'
This for my fam, this for the fam, do this for the fam
Hop out of the Lamb', hop onto the 'gram
What the fuck was you sayin'?
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave, piss in your grave
I'll piss on your face
I'll piss on your bitch, I'll piss on your date, ugh

You walk up on the raised edge
Hands out for balance
You slip and you almost grab mine, but you find your feet
And I never wanted so much someone to fall
It’s just been a weekend
But in my mind
We summer in France with our genius daughters now
And you teach me to play the piano

You call
I'll be there
What's more?
I'm scared of the phone
Don't ring it
Please know
That I'm just trying to find
Some way to keep me in your mind
And later on
Everyone will say ""it was cool""

""She had Billie Eilish style""
""Movin' to Berlin for a little while""
""Tryna find something to hold on to""
""Never texts me nothing
But she wants to tell me
She's not that hard to find""
And ""message me if you change your mind""
Darlin', I'll keep fine

[Verse 2]
And if we’re on a burnin' starship
The escape pods filled with your friends
Your childhood film photos
There's no room for me to go
Oh, I'd wait there
Float with the wreckage
Fashion a longsword
Traverse the Milky Way
Tryna get home to you
And you bring some piece of the stars

[Pre-Chorus]

43XL on my baggy tee
Freddy G, and scars on my shoulders see
Wannabe, they all look like some wannabes
I'ma leave, every leaf that grows after me
Come and see, bitch, we deep, human centipede
On my feet, there's no e's, see no enemies
Kilo green, speak my heart till I rest in peace
All I see, road warriors, eternal sleep
I'ma leave everything for my family
Gotta go hard for myself, I look after me
20 e's, double g, never fall asleep
Eyes on sight, ancient whispers they still follow me

I woke up this morning, August 3rd
It's been a pretty slow and uneventful summer
Went to visit a friend in Santa Fe
Went to New Orleans and went to see my family
Woke up this morning and it occurred
I needed one more track to finish up my record
I was feeling out of fuel and uninspired
Laid on my bed too long, a little down, a little tired
Met my girl and we walked down Union Street
I was scattered and my head was in a bunch of places
Bought a $350 pair of lampshades
And we ate at Perry's and I ordered crab cakes
[Break 1]
Blue crab cakes

[Verse 2]
She said I seemed distracted and asked what was going on with me
I said, ""I can't explain it, it's a middle age thing""
She said, ""Okay,"" and ate her eggs Benedict
And I looked at the walls cluttered with sports bar shit

[Verse 3]
Got on the phone and I called my mother
And called my father, talked a little bit with my sister
She's got a new boyfriend, he's a deer hunter
And she's getting used to venison
And my dad's still fighting with his girlfriend
About his flirting with the girls in Panera Bread
My mom is good but sounded out of breath
I worry so much about her, I worry to death

The other night I went and saw The Postal Service
Ben's my friend, but getting there was the worst
Trying to park and getting up the hill
And find a spot amongst the drunk kids staring at their cells
Standing at the back with the crowd of eight thousand
I thought of Ben when I met him in 2000 at a festival in Spain
He was on the small stage then, and I didn't know his name
Now, he's singing at the Greek and he's busting moves
And my legs were hurting, and my feet were, too
I called him after, said, ""I'll skip the backstage ""Hi/Bye""
But thanks for the nice music and all the exercise""

[Break 4]
And we laughed and it was alright
And we laughed and it was alright
And it was alright

[Verse 5]
There's a thin line between a middle-aged guy with a backstage pass
And a guy with a gut hanging around like a jackass
Everybody there was twenty years younger at least
I'll leave with this, not my fondest memory
I carried my legs back down the hill
Gave my backstage passes to two cute Asian girls
I drove to my place near Tahoe
Got in my hot tub and I thought, ""Well, that's how it goes""
And it was quiet, and I was listening to the crickets
And Ben's still out there, selling lots of tickets
And though I'm contented, there's a tinge of competitiveness
But Ben's my friend, and I know he gets it
Then, in a couple of days, my meltdown passed
Back to the studio doing twelve-hour shifts
Singing a song about one thing or another
Another day behind the microphone this summer

Fuck around, nigga, and you'll never make it

This like my third cup, can't even taste it

My mama said I'ma go out like my dad
I walk in the house, knapsack full of crack
Pistol on my waist and I got my mask

And still owe bills, pay dues forever

I get angry with athletic ease
Break common laws in twos and threes

Don't call me boring, it's just cause I like you

To the place where I could feel your heart
Is this the end or just the start
Of something really, really beautiful
Wrapped up and disguised as
Something really really ugly?
Won't you...

Come by and see me, I'm a love-letter away
I'd break your name before I'd say:
""I really love you, love you,""
No, I don't care if you saw
I watched every inch of film flash across your Roman features
And I loved it, loved it

No, I don't care if...

You think I'm eager to shut your eyes
Well, I'm sorry everybody knows
You can't break me with your gutter prose
Would you believe it? She sent me a letter
The ring, it nearly weighs her down
She's got another boy, oh boy

Steady your ears, steady your ears and read my lips
Poetry is not a luxury, it's how I break this home
And when I'm really ill, won't you cradle me?
Man is not a noble animal, but maybe woman is

Remember, I heard you...

Inside your room you said:
You'd never really live until your back's against the wall
Oh did you really mean it?
No, I never break my gaze, if just to see the scar
Remain reflected in your eyes
I think it's time to go home

Godspeed...

I break the law once every week to feel your touch

Do you feel better? Older?

We, like the breeze, flow straight out of our lids
Them, they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us, floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop record
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms, man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion?
Where kinky hair goes, to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut, we push it off the corner
How was the buzz, entire hip-hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock
[Chorus: Butterfly]
But I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that

[Verse 2: Ladybug & Butterfly]
We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeter cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them, they be crazy down with the five Nat'
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me, I be digging it with the Bug verse
Us, we be freaking 'til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile, so I say, ""Hi"" (What's up?)
Who understood? Yeah, understood the plans
Him, heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip, let borders get loose
How to consume all the beats just like juice
If it's the shit, we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, hip-hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock, it don't matter, I'm fatter
Ask Butter how I zone (Man, Cleopatra Jones)

She sweats the beats and asks me could she puff it
Me, I got crew, kid, seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs

Why does your black feel like business to me?
Industry lies never line up on screen (Facts)
Peggy keep scoring, I feel like the Dream
Yeah, what you want, ugh
Y'all love the fake, I've been real from the start
Never hesitate to shoot at a star
Stocked up on weapons and pussy and cars
Just thought you should know, ugh
Look at this lane that I made, it was vacant
These veggie grill niggas don't really want beef
Real niggas dying and fakers replace 'em
Now I see my DNA all in y'all beats
Talk, niggas just rap, don't back up what they talk
Pray for me, got so much smoke in my heart
Rap like I'm gifted and grew up on guard, yeah
Shorty want dick (What?), money, and leverage
One out of three, feel like three when I'm in it (Skrrt)
Peggy the G.O.A.T., more like the feds
As soon as you see me you know that it's finished
And, how can you tell that he's winnin'? (How?)
Floated right through the pandemic, no limits
Stunted creatively, don't got a vision
I die for my pride, you be hiding in gimmicks
Glock with a switch, turn a vegan to spinach (Brrt)
PM-50, we ain't beefin', you dinner
Turn a ""I'll do it"" right into ""Who did it?""
Some you can't speak, you should just buy a ticket
Choke 'em to death with the smoke from this fye
Giving these alt niggas hope when I die
Call up my mama then hang up the line (Bitch)

With no place to run to send em to the gates of hell
Pull up in a coupe that's gun proof hunt you

The river's chandelier
I knew it, you were near
Dandy, over cross
Shook my hand and laid me down
River’s chandelier
Took my blood and you were near
(La la la)
Swiftly I come back
Swiftly I come back
I wonder where do you go?
To the hand, knees of all the old men folks
I wonder where do you go when I'm not by your side?
River of black rain and hollowing sun
My house filled with maggots and insects of dust
The cradle is done and we're all just made of
[Verse 2]
Nothing, nothing inside us does matter
Something, something must shatter our dreams
I want, I want to see you again
I’m on my death bed and it feels so strange
To, to feel that it's all normal to me
My strange, dark reality
Yes
I must confess

[Verse 3]
Where do you go when I'm not near?
I see the river's chandelier
We run, we jump, we don't get far
Our traveled scars they stay at large
I want to see what I become
I come ahead to angel songs
I wonder if it's all worthwhile
I slit it all open to see what's inside
(See what, see what's inside, I stay inside)

Uh, Hahaha, Uh
Only I can get away with something like this
Y'all know my name

[Verse 1]
I'm an uptown boy with Soho flava
The beat is D minor but I'm oh so major
I do my own thing so I owe no favors
Can't do it now then I won't do it later
Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce
But it's gravy so boy get lost
Nah I ain't cocky I'm just stating the obvious
H-O the boss and I'm making his pockets rich
Hate it or not I am great and about to get greater
Hit the Peja like I play with Stojakovic
I keep it real and my ladies do the same
High class chicks that be crazy in the brain
Style so mean, swag is vicious
Smile O.D, ass delicious
Stay getting money no need for ebay
My heart is Harlem world, but I'm loving BK

I ain't got no problem wit girls out in Harlem but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
See I had a dope fling wit a girl on Queens but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
(Damn sure ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)

[Verse 2]
My girl Angie can't be a groupie or whore
She bout getting money in her juicy couture
Do she get bored with the Gucci of course
So the Louis she sports til it ain't new anymore
Then she cop another one makin hoes gettin madder
Gettin more money so the price don't matter
Ain't seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter
And if you think she bad then her friends are way badder
Kendra's a Christian never seen freakin
In church every weekend she need to be deacon
Had a model bitch name Viva we ain't speakin
But I had her screamin whenever I was beatin
She been callin, creepin, crawlin
Maybe she would chill if I would beat it often
And Rhonesha's fly and she sweeter than Splenda

[Verse]
I used to wake up in my room in the mornin'
Put on my dirty shoes in the mornin'
Heard mama cryin' last night
Think the lights finna go out
Only thing on my mind is hittin' a lick
Her nigga in prison for doin' some shit
Say I'ma go to prison for doin' some shit
Only thing on my mind is boomin' a bitch
12 Stout Street, I hated that house
I had to learn early on bein' a man about
My mama ain't never buy me shit
I sold drugs and robbed for all my shit
Mama said, ""Baby, that was years ago""
I'm stressed 'bout shit happened years ago
This shit'd take a bitch years to know
I cried in the cold 'til my tears was froze
I hit a lick to help my mama out
How the fuck my mom the one kick me out?
How the fuck you gonna send me out to thе streets?
How the fuck you gonna say I can't come home to sleep?
How thе fuck I come out your pussy, you choose your husband like you knew that nigga before me?
How the fuck you gon' turn your back on me?
How the fuck you gon' leave me flat on E?
How you gon' do that, knowin' they killed my dad?
You supposed to be my mom and my dad
I wish that fuckin' house would burn down
I couldn't tell you then but, shit, I'll tell you now
For so many years, I held it down
I never in my life wanted to sell drugs
I would've been cool with playin' games and shit
But instead, I'm runnin' with the gang and shit
Robberies done turned into shootings
Your son done did a gang of shit
It'd take a year to explain this shit
We don't stay safe, we stay dangerous
They took my brother, that fucked me up
Perc' after Perc', they fuckin' me up
Thousand Percs later, still don't do nun'
Shit's barely workin', supposed to make me numb
Had flashbacks to when I was young
Bitches used to laugh and call me a bum
I was with Face, shot my first gun
Before Neo or Jet Li, I was the one
My mom ain't see it but the streets did
Said I wouldn't be shit, streets made me shit
Going through withdrawal, got me sick
I'm stressin' back to back, I'm 'bout to flip
Don't look at me funny, you don't know shit 'bout me
Stood on the block with dreams of a Audi
Had a nightmare sleepin' in my Audi
A nigga caught me lackin' and pulled me out it

I just want my credit like I'm Soulja
Camo like Rambo, big draco 'cross the shoulder
I'm fine-tuned on iTunes if you shuffle
Test the boy Le Suess like I came to tune your motor
Motherfuck a mumble rapper, I'd rather be a mogul
Million dollar market deals closin' on my mobile
Keep the grass cut, got a phobia for cobra
You should low-key fuck the world when I'm vulgar
Man, I used to listen to that nigga when I was younger
Found out he's a poser when I got a lil' older
My bitch used to model for the Vogue, but she older
A truce and a foe, sittin' 'round watchin' poker
No buns in the oven, or babies in the stroller
Just guns in the cupboard, and some ladies comin' over
See I'm a pretty boy, manicures with the rollers
And babushkas on the head, like grandmothers and the Roman
Some women throw me bras, some women throw me roses
Might even flash a titty while she on a nigga shoulders
They goin' crazy at my shows, she passed out if I noticed her
Yeah, we in the buildin' 'til the shit is for foreclosure
Yeah, we not the same, I ain't tryna play it like a lame nigga
Switch a gang, switch the beat, like the track that's playin' (That's playin')

Been ill since I was twelve, was Rocky but ended swell
Now say Tyler, watch these motherfuckers start ringing bells (Ding-dong)

This shit so mean, nice rocks and I get stones
This shit so clean and bright, bold (Yeah)
The gold got a grip hold
All these Lucky Charms like a thick bowl
The diamonds all appraised (Nigga), yeah
Y'all go to Avianne and y'all get a lease in that bitch
My earlobes got them yellow boogers like I sneezed in that bitch (Achoo)
Your 808s is dry, you need to put some grease in that bitch
And let it sit, nigga, fuck what you heard (Fuck what you heard)
And fuck rap, I make a living off that four-letter word (GOLF WANG)
One-stop shop, nigga, just to sell them shoes
The profit margins lookin' higher than them airplane views
Y'all getting fucked in your deals, and they share that lube
I push the cum-colored Beamer and the inside blue (Skrrrt)
I push an Elon too, and the 675
The Longtail like the mane that's on A$AP Lou
Whips, whips, whips, whips, Kunta started a fight
The 720 ordered and I still go ride me a bike
But don't follow in yours (Nah), Vill behind me in sight (Yeah)
My niggas strictly like 9s, like young Mike and his type (Pew-pew)
Rip, you better zip that lip and zip up quick
And shit, he'd probably suck my dick then kiss his bitch (Mwah)

He didn't notice that the lights had changed

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

That bitch popping pussy for a shopping spree
You ain't spending more than ten, you can't shop with me
My niggas think you sweet, they plan a robbery
Sixteen, seventeen kept a Glock with me
These niggas out here looking, yeah, real sweet
You are not just yelling nigga, I got real beef
This chopper done made more beats than Chief Keef
I'm with Kaine, but I'm rocking Alexander McQueen
You wouldn't spend over a hunnid, you don't really like lean (You don't like it)
Tris and some Wock, that excite me
This bitch freaky, she got some panties that say 'bite me'
But all this money in my pocket, it ain't gonna like me
All this hate, all this anger, this just how his life be
Look like Doe Boy in these forces and this white tee
All these colors in my chain, like I'm Ice T
This the wock, with the perc, it's tryna fight me
My bitch want a BBL, think she-
Cartier's on my fucking eyes, nigga I can see
I'm the flyest nigga in the world you gon' ever meet
If I'm tryna stack a m' why the fuck you think I need sleep
Stop making all that noise 'cause that choppa put that boy to sleep
This SRT is spinnin', I'm in Atlanta lookin' for a happy ending
You know why I love women, yuh, until they start bitching
'Til they start telling their feelings
I got my nigga with me third wheeling
The way that I'm taking care of my niggas the same way I'm taking care of my children
Man you tryna save that bitch, I'm tryna save up a million
I need a scientist bitch, while I'm hot, she calling me brilliant
I hate when I got no lean 'cause my body got the itches
You know I'm a fiend for them licks, I get to trippin'
I was robbing anybody, I ain't care 'bout no attention
Was robbing anybody, didn't care 'bout nobody spinnin'
I'm in love with Christmas, but I'm on the block grinchin'
You a little fucking minion, sit back and count up my spinach
Military sticks, I ain't nothing but a lieutenant
And I like foreign whips, ain't none of these shits be rented
Tell the police I'mma be good, I ain't tryna finish no sentence
Hit me with probation, man I swear those crackers trippin'
Catching niggas acting bad, yeah, they do that for a living
I really do not get it, that cannot get my attention
You want respect with that badge, nigga, I don't respect no snitchin'

Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh

Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out

On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up

Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah

Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
And I’m the kingdom all night, got the key, girl
Splash, splash, splash, so icy like the SeaWorld
Cuts in her arm, here I go, make secrets
And the city still blue, yeah, like the summer was
In my eyes bright lights, you can tell it was
See me going in, baby, you can still have it all
Need the white dress when the night, when the night falls
And you know I want it, I can't hide it (I have you where I wanted)
Can't try, can’t try, can't try, can't deny it
Runnin', runnin' (Becausе your friend has my friend)
Run for the lovе, not here for the violence
And we got each other like bones and blood
And we got each other like brothers in mud

Back of the club when the lights go down
Sniffing glue and I’m seeing sounds

Fucked up last summer, I can't get enough
This steel in my head like a sword cut

Guess I can be whatever you want me to be

Inte många fattar vad jag menar
Vågorna kom när jag segla
Om jag lever imorn, jag har segrat
Det är crazy

I'm waiting for somebody to come save me
I wanna change the world but never change me
Vill de se mig död, they gotta spray me

It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you

Lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
She said, ""Baby, keep me closely, love it when you hold me
Know that I'm a real one, I don't do no ghostin'
I know that you love me, you don't gotta show me
Off to the world, please, hide me from the police
Everywhere you go, we together, inseparable
You know I'm down for whatever, protective of you
I don't wanna use protection with you
But the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose
Never put you in a jam, hold whatever for you
When you first shot your shot, I knew you would be the one to hit the spot
Only you can make it clap for the homies, I am not
On the late nights, me and you, circling the block
Tryna make it pop
Put that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park
Hope we don't get caught
Don't you break my heart
Love how you illuminate my thoughts""

Damn, can't believe they took you from me
Kickin' in your front door, lookin' for me
Hid me in our secret place
Nothing I could do for you but sit and wait, contemplate
Did we leave a trail? Did we make mistakes?
Can't drop on your bail, can't check on your case
Know that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid
You'll probably never get to see the light of day
I'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now
We should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now
At least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down
Is you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?
Still here I am, waiting 'round

The emotional affair was the best
Intoxicatin', let's not ruin it with sex
Relationship: doctor/patient
Kush cake like LASIK
Resting bitch face, breastplate, Wonder Woman bracelets
You can shoot arrows all day kid
Hearts scrawled in wet pavement
Ozymandias is the wavelength
Here today, gone tomorrow, sorrow
White rum in my sorrel
Somethin' old, somethin' new, somethin' borrowed
Blew his stack on oysters piled like Kilimanjaro
Crostini, charred avocado, draped in lardo
Still got no quarrel with thеm Viet Congs
Speak sepia tonеs, everyone I know is gone
No stigmata, they put nails through arms
Temple Grandin, keep the cattle calm
Side-saddle, took Carrie to the prom
Joanne Chesimard, windows open, nights warm
Power cuts, no ice, so the cuba libre's strong
Fire in the cane fields, generational trauma
At the museum, eyes glassy from the pain pills
Me and her in the diorama

Burnt offering in the desert
Shining city up on the hill, I burned it like Nebuchadnezzar
This world, hard to even take its measure
Three rooms filled with Incan treasure
Still strangled the king 'cause it's now or never
It's a freedom in admitting it's not gonna get better
Washing your hands of people you known forever
I'd be a liar if I feign surprise, a goat eats where it's tethered
Treat African proverbs like Vegas flyers, I float above the peasants
Too clever by half, halftime down twenty
I'm not that good at math, but common sense, I got plenty
(It's fuckin' over)
In person, these rappers' watches look temptin'
The chain say envy, but PTSD keep me countin', never spendin'
My accountant is a head full of bad memories and sad endings
It's all payment pending
I'm not concerned with generational wealth, that's its own curse
Anything you want on this cursed Earth
Probably better off gettin' it yourself, see what it's worth

The photograph of young Tutankhamun
Spaghetti links tangled like ramen
Everything behind the mask rotten
I tell people I keep it so you not forgotten, but that's cap
I thought pillars of salt, but she too smart for lookin' back
Mid-eighties in the rear-view of a gold Mercedes
Midday sun make the crocodiles lazy
Money phone pocket dial, run come save me
Sweet old ladies poisoning pigeons in the park
For a lark, make mine strychnine, life is a zipline in the dark
Spare me the Hallmark Karl Marx
I was in the Dollar Tree break-room playin' cards with quarters
Stop loss posters on the wall, brick and mortar
I watched the planet from orbit, remorseless

Turn my headphones down a little bit, yeah
(Statik Selektah)
No 'Tune, turn my voice up a little bit
Yeah

[Verse: Jack Harlow]
Nightmares about my deepest secrets out
Two months inside the crib, it's time for me to leave the house
I wanna put my hands around the girl that I've been thinkin' 'bout
At a distance I feel like she's someone I would keep around, but
When we're together I be thinking, ""Damn, I need to get back to Atlanta""
I be thinking ""Damn, I need to get back to the music""
Time keeps slipping, gotta watch the way I use it
Lot of new acquaintances, I watch the way they moving
Watch how much stock I'm putting in the way I look 'cause it's gon' wash away the soonest
The girls I talk to want the truth from me directly
But I tell 'em in my music, it's an awful way to do it
I would like to find love 'fore my time's up
Don't get me wrong, I know I'm young and I ain't tryna rush
It just seems nice
But it's tough when nobody matches up to the hype or really are the way they seem like
Right after Mac Miller died, Statik took me to the club and told me what a great person that he was
First person I had spoke to that was hurt the way he was
It stuck with me then and it still does
At times it feels like the end times
I feel like I'm gon' get everything I want in time, but will it be in time?
A pandemic and climate change at the same time
Doesn't make you feel like everything's fine, quite the opposite
I'm a skeptic but I'm still quite the optimist
I'ma try to stay that way 'til I do not exist
I'm hoping for some more time, in fact, a lot of it
[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
T— T— Time
Time (Time's limited), I'm hoping for some more time
T— T— Time
Time (All the time), I'm hoping for some more time, in fact, a lot of it

[Bridge]

I know you've never seen this side of me before
You know I won't get far if I don't let you go

I need some help, might lose myself

She's in my life again, stuck in my mind again
She's worried I'm high again, gambling my life again

To be or not to be, I'd rather never be

Hundred round Drac' and the long nose, thuggin' on 8 with the .44s
High-speed chase through the Drug Zone
Runnin' from Jake and the popo

Short a hundred Percs, need another jar
Been a hot boy with them rock stars
Watching out for the sweep off of Dunbar
Little Grand Marquis just be unmarked
Sitting on a corner in the hood parked
Said he beat his gun charge, seen't 'em in the hood
Hop out the back of a squad car
Either you trap or you farm hot
Choppers with straps on the arm stock
Slidin' with Glocks in the armrest
Got some get-back, we ain't duckin' no wreck
Put that chopper to a nigga lips like some fuckin' Carmex
Blow the Artex, DJ run it back like a fuckin' hot track
Thuggin' in the projects, I wish I could bring my nigga Mas back
Turn your town into Old Country Buffet

We was back and forth down in K-Y, runnin' with the Wildcats
Met my young dog up in Mount Jax to get off the loud pack

Twist his top back, we'll peel his cap

Broken glass, middle of the street
See the bricks chipped from the ricochet
Wipe a opp off the hit-list, slidin' off with them misfits
Ridin' 'round with this big bitch, I just made another chicken play
Don't let that money go to your head

A day, in a week, in a year
Where e'rything exactly as you feared
Lightning could strike me right here
Right here, holdin' a phone to my ear
The rest of my life I'ma be like, ""Yo, I was standin' right there.""
Boxes under the stairs
Found some old Nike Airs, still tight
Dust 'em off like I remember workin' nights for this pair
Nightmares of what it'll be like
Lights from your flight's landing gear draw near
If I knew you was comin', woulda picked somethin' more debonair
Best laid plans of mice and Tin Men
I was dead, didn't need to pretend when the bayonet went in
A army of fiends, she put chrysanthemums and daffodils in the burnt end of they crack stems
Tears streamed down they cheeks, just really, really weep
But in the end
They hit-They hit the pipe again
If I lose, it was rigged
I'm the man if I win
Before settlin' on a narrative, I took 'em all for a spin
On black ice
Steering locked
Driftin'
Calm from the shock, oncomin' brights hot
On the windshield it's one particular raindrop
Caught strugglin' in the incandescence
Took my hands off the wheel and cut the engine

[Chorus: MOTHERMARY]
Do we fight it?
Do we like it?
I don't know, we recognize it
How do we recognize it? (How do we know?)
So we light up (Do we fight it?)
So we like it (Do we like it?)

Put drums under Bach
It's a game of inches, like when Police beat you to the fuckin' spot
Kept walking, head down, waitin' to hear ""stop""
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn underneath the three clocks
Unsurprised when the choppers chop
I read the play, hatchet job, but you work with what you got

Life is just two quarters in the machine
But, either you got it or don't that's the thing
I was still hittin' the buttons, ""Game Over"" on the screen
Dollar movie theater, dingy foyer, little kid, not a penny to my name
Fuckin' with the joystick, pretendin' I was really playin'
Pretendin' I was really playin'
Pretendin' I was really playin'

I pull up, jump out, choke you out, hit the death roll
Then slide off like Bo Jackson in Tecmo Bowl

You can catch me in Tibet
But if you try me I'ma put that ass to bed
From this top floor view I could see the whole strip
Jump out the window like I got wings on
Your physical features will turn into chopped cheese, dog
And I flee off and drive Z4's
With skis where the wheels supposed to be
End your evening with a real ferocious knee
Have you holding something frozen on your cheek
Swinging double hundred pound clubs from Persia like The Sheik
I love the taste of raw meat
I rock the long white robe Allah fashion
Off the roof with the scope
Calm, I took Lamaze classes
Ask your moms, your boy's been gone
When he was rocking Sean John
I steer the Caddy like I got one arm
Smoke drugs like I got four lungs
Knock the horse out you rode in on
Hit him twice 'cause he had a chin on him
Caught the ball then I Hit the spin on him
I need the money on the table by this morning

I never ask a chick for her number, I only give her mine
Fuck it if they hit me, they hit me 'cause either way I'm fine
I park the new 850 next to the old one
And gently place the two-tone Rollie next to the gold one
We got options over here, baby boy
Chop the yay and employ
Catch a flight to sip the wine we enjoy
I try to tell you that we different, I mean different different
Achieving accurately everything you niggas didn't
At this point been gettin' money longer than I haven't
And every fabric placed on my flesh could win a pageant
I'm talkin' beauty, I'm talkin' Gucci, I'm talkin' Louis
If you try to say I ain't fly then son, you never knew me

Niggas owe us reparations, fuck apologies
Doing pullups wrapped in my jewels is like a weight vest

And now coming down the aisle
Accompanied by no-motherfuckin'-body, it's young Bronny
Yeah, steppin' to the plate like Barry with the brace on
Standing at a weight around 248
Ain't none of it bacon, motherfucker's a snake bit
I spray the whip, make you take a shit
I come right over to your table and flip your plate of ribs
Razor's Edge a motherfucker off the bridge
Take him to where Satan lives
Hands on fire when them dice get to shaking, bitch
I'm in the Range lookin' strange as shit
Uh, Baklava never salty
Yo bitch, get the fuck up off me
Don't try to kiss me with your lips all chalky
In the Trans Am, you could feel the kicks from the horsies
Bitch, I'm high all four seasons
[Break: Hologram & Action Bronson]
Hand wash my drawers and hang 'em from the clothing line
Album's on sale, I'm working on a clothing line
I hold the spine of some foes of mine
If you stand the M16 on its nose, it comes up to my shoulder line
Make a motherfucker do the Dutty Wine
Yo, shit, my fault dawg, speak your mind
That shit is fire, yo, my bad
Just continue on, I won't-I won't disrupt you again, my bad
Go 'head
[Verse 2: Hologram]
Hand wash my drawers and hang 'em from the clothing line

I hold the spine of some foes of mine
The gun strapped behind the toilet 'cause I'm with the shits
I wouldn't hit your bitch, she smell like fish and grits
Shrimp and grits, death and pure wickedness
I'm the weed man to that bitch you got a crush on
I knock a hundred dollars off the zip to get my fuck on
S550 interior, big and brown like my son's eyes
Every bitch pussy to me is only one size
And she my little fuck thang
I eat the pussy like a mukbang, let my nuts hang
I got two things to say, yo, I'm drinking and drugging
Your side bitch and main bitch call me their husband

I macrodose while I'm mackin' hoes

Hit the button on the ejection seat
'Cause I don't want no motherfuckers next to me
Seven-foot Sicilians dealin' ecstasy, make 'em do the pepper seed
And I'm your bitch's first selection when it comes to penis
Have her squirting in the car while we listen to a T-Pain G-mix
Come down the spiral staircase like hair on Hasidics, hail Caesar
I don't know shit about jail either

Laid in the dirt, face gettin' placed on a shirt
Lift your little fuckin' body in the air
And send it straight through the earth (Hahahaha)
Take 'em to church
Man, I just copped the 911 Turbo
Only drive it twenty miles an hour though
With your bitch in a seat giving me fellatio
Hard bottom Crocodile scraping across the floor of the Bellagio

A young DiCaprio also, with a more muscular torso (Hahahaha)

Everywhere I look I see an ignorant fool
Why must I be placed inside a world so distasteful
Only thing I smile for is children and a blunt too
All you little rappers are so easily immeasurable
Boy we heard your music and that shit is so unpleasurable
Why the fuck do labels pay these niggas to record you for
You might be doing shows but no one comes and gives a fuck
But when we do a show we will come light your whole city up
I pull up and turn him into a duck, he ain't showing up
I can tell from by the way he talk that he a bitch boy
From across the street I saw him faint, lemme pull him up
He was talking plenty damn shit until he sobered up
Bitch they think I'm Ryu mixed with Ken when I upper cut
Bitch call me Kazuya when you know I'm finna power up
Bitch know I'm Heihachi let my squad send them choppers up
I don’t need no guns, bitch, I’ll pull a helicopter up
She was talking proper till she fucked around and hit my blunt
Now she stumbling, talking like she from from where I’m from
Bitch you niggas ain't come from from where I'm from
It ain't no fucking life
Boy you niggas weak, watch you be born and dead the same night
Play with me I bring the damn missile to a knife fight
I'm the type to send that boy to hell just cause I felt like it
I control myself sometimes but most times I'm on auto-pilot
That's a fair warning in the air - I'm unconscious and violent
I could turn your whole neighborhood into a lost island
After that you see me smoking blunts, I don't give no fuck, smiling
Now me and my niggas being bothered by them label scouters

Man these motherfuckers sleepin'
While Bronson bangin' pots and pans
Gotta understand these fake fucks are not your mans
Me, disappear, where? I'm right here
Creepin' in the cold nights air
To get on my level take fifty light-years
My jewelry boxes like the habitat for white bears
After I'm finished in the sauna
I jump into some freezing cold water
Shake it like I'm reading from the Torah
I'm 'bout to tat a skull on my skull
Hangin' from a snake's mouth comin' out a pyramid
Now I'm at the steakhouse gettin' dirty looks
Guess I shoulda wore a different shirt
Poppin' wheelies on the Harley down 53rd
Break the guitar on your head after my solo shit
I coulda been in Guns N' Roses dolo, bitch
Got the Box Chevy jumpin' like a pogo stick
Don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo kid? Uh
Yeah, don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo
Like Jerry West and Teddy Ballgame
I don't wear Balmain, swing the ball and chain executioner style
Dirty mountain tiger to the face
Better strap up, I'm 'bout to see space
As I entered, I felt everything was centered
Oh shit, I think I'm back in the placenta
But then I woke up in a Nissan Sentra

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag

[Sample]
""Somebody warn the west, nigga ain't runnin""
""Somebody, nigga ain't runnin no more""
""The Legend of Nigga in color, rated PG
Parental guidance suggested""

[Intro]
Uh, yeah, fo' sho'
Niggas be comin at me like, ""Yo, yo Fred man
You a real nigga, dawg"", yes baby, real nigga (Real nigga)
I be like (From front to the back) ""Respect man"" (Respect)
These fake niggas done lowered the bar, you know what I'm sayin'?
[Verse 1]
Niggas be like ""Fred, you ain't never lied""
Fuck the rap shit, my gangsta been solidified
Still do my business on the side
Bitch, if you polices, then pay me no never mind
I was thuggin', black and red laces in my number threes
Take a pull up off the wood and let that motherfucker breathe
Sit outside a busta crib and let that motherfucker leave
Walk his ass back in and put him on his motherfuckin' knees
Thuggin', never takin' no for an answer
Might just take a loss, but bitch, I’d rather take my chances
This liquor got me lurkin' where you live at in the night time
59Fifty to the left, but I'm in my right mind
Thuggin', pants gon' be saggin' til I'm 40
Still lyrically sharper than any short bus shawty
Phonies ain't gon' throw me in this minstrel show
These labels see how far up in they mouth my dick can go
So gon', choke on this meat, throw my song on repeat
Might move away one day but I'm always gon' belong to the streets

[Chorus]
I'm straight thuggin', uh
And it feels so good, uh, and it feels so right
Uh, yeah, and it feels so good
Uh, and it feels so right
'Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

Selling you the science of the street rap
Every motherfuckin' show I do is off the meat rack
I done been to jail and did my best not to repeat that
I'm tryin' to feed my family, give a fuck about your feedback
Critically acclaimed but that shit don't mean a thang
When you rocking mics and stealing microwaves, cooking 'caine
Never trickin' on a dame, I'm too cold for you broke hoes
Don't let the knob hit your booty when the door close, bitch
She let me hit it cause I'm thuggin'
Squares need not apply, I'm so fly, might fuck her cousin
Swiftly 'bout to stick a sweet dick in your sweetheart
Then get some groceries off my geeker EBT card
Why the feds worried 'bout me clocking on this corner
When there's politicians out here getting popped in Arizona?

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm thuggin', bitch
And it feels so good, uh, and it feels so right
Yeah, yeah, and it feels so good
Uh, and it feels so right
'Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

[Verse 3]
""We’re not against rappin', we're against those thugs""
Can't be legit when every nigga in your clique sold drugs
Predicate felons in my faculty, real killers can vouch for me
Teach a kid at the crib or your children might cop an ounce from me
And smoke out in the Chevy with us
Cause in the past, my low-class black ass would serve my own fucking family members
I hate to say it, ain't no need to be discreet
If she don't cop from me, she get it from a nigga up the street
Cause he thuggin', and yo, she'd probably suck his dick for it
She turnt out so it ain't shit to turn a trick for it
My uncle last bitch put him on the glass dick
Tried to rob a man to feed his habit, he got blasted
I live on borrowed time, my expiration date I passed it
So lock me up forever, but this shit is everlastin'
[Chorus]
I'm thuggin', huh
And it feels so good, uh, and it feels so right
Uh, yeah, and it feels so good
Uh, and it feels so right
'Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin, bitch

´cause its been a whole year since a young nigga shot my pops
Been a whole year and i still don't know who popped my pops
Aye but I ain’t gone tell nobody cause that’s how I was taught
And the cops can't find nobody causes dem boys to soft
And you reap what you sew a play in the plot

Couple new hunninds for a brand new Glock
What else, and i ain’t gone fold and i ant gone top
And i probably won't find nem folks
But i ain’t gone stop
So please dont try to ask me why i might go insane
Whole lotta shit done changed in my fucked up brain
Since my first love got fucked by a lame ass nigga (huh)
No namе ass nigga, 5.99 for some Hanes ass nigga
Big bro said dont trip lil buddy that shit build character
Bеtter get yo carrots up cause these hoes ain’t never gone care enough
And my mom on register
That a bitch don't want you to cherish her
She a cash money predator
So there ain’t no point in sweatin her
So what should I do?
Imma get me a bitch that look like you
Tell her come through
And fuck outta spite
Just drop a Duce so the juice In the sprite
What else?
I might act brand new
If you tryna come through then leave for the night
You finna get left cause you can't get right
And you might get left cause they hoes getting pipe
What else? (aye)
Cause i finna stress if it ain’t about money

Roll Cadillacs never lie on raps
Smoke killer herb till my lungs collapse
Lost two grand last night shooting craps
The I hit the Ritz and bought a few laps
Just got a letter from my old best friend
Doing twenty-five in the federal pen
Wanna come home but he said until then
Could I look over his three children
They wake em up at five am for Fruit Loops
Draped in white overalls and black boots
Used to drive a Lac sipping gin and juice
Now we need money for some chips and soups
Run around town with a sack of rocks
Polo shirt with the matching socks
Mom I promise one day I'mma stop
I'mma grow up and be a astro-naut

Home catching hell cause I love my weed

Three stripes on the Gucci
Lyrics back to back, 63s, we all had Uzis (Skrrt)
Selene knee-highs over the face, lookin' spooky
If you ever bought a three for fifty, nigga, you knew me (Nigga, you knew me)
In the ghetto, AP strapped the coke out a soupie (Whip)
Neck full of Veert pearls, lookin' all bougie
Greeted my fiends with ""As-salamu alaykum""
Moms was a basehead, could blame it on Reagan
What if I tell you drug dealers God's favorite?
Three hunnid for the plate and didn't taste it (Uh-uh)
You ever left a tip so big, you fuck the waitress? (Woo)
I rock my DOOM Dunks with red laces
I pray for my niggas with Fed cases
Who that nigga in that big ass bracelet?
Ayo, looking like a Margiela model at the Guggenheim (Ah)
Turned three to eight, that shit too divine (Width)
Chrome Heart goggles like I'm scuba diving
Hermès seats, it look like the coupe was flyin' (Skrrt)
On the counter, never knew my life would turn this great
Drunk so much Chase, I threw up my Papi Steak (Ah)
Anybody violate, I annihilate (Boom, boom, boom)
I switched the band on the Dick, you rockin' time today
I could've fucked your bitch but I don't got the time today (I don't got the time today)
Tie everybody up, we gotta find the yay (We gotta find the yay)
Jamaican tank top, Jean-Paul Gaultier (Woo, brra)
Airholes on the TEC (Woo, brra) fuck nigga, I don't play (Brr)
Three stoves in the kitchen, two in the basement
Who that nigga in that big ass bracelet?
[Verse 2: Stove God Cooks]
They wire the money now, they used to wire the room (We was)
We was cuttin' dog food out designer balloons (Inshallah)
I was prayin' in the dirt one day I bloom (Haha)
Become Hov in a metal mask, I be Shawn DOOM (We die big)
We live enormous, you die big or you die alone (Brra, bah, bah,)
Either way you die alone, my shooter Pat Mahomes (Brr)
My bullet thrower
I was court-side watching Syracuse play Villanova (Go)
I flew here straight from a vineyard in Sonoma (Woo)
Talkin' cocaine around weed growers (Haha)
Bitch, I just had dinner across the room from Oprah
My young boy jumped out in Giuseppe Cobras and the snow dumpin' (Brrra)
This shit is nothing, these pussy niggas bluffin' (Woo, go)
Every issue get aired out or cleared up (Yeah)
Chanel prayer rug, my bitch said I ain't there enough
I rolled up twenty bands, put it in her hair and told her ""Wear it up"" (Told her put her bun up)
You need to praise God and fear us (You should)
Find the illest, who dope then?
I end them niggas with two shakes of a goat pen
I wrote this in the kitchen over the stove while the dope was spinnin' (Woo)
They shot him through the door while he was openin' it (Brra, nah, bah)
Stove Jesus on the cross screamin' ""No forgiveness"" (No forgiveness)

Drain Gang

[Verse]
Rhinestone Ricky, to this lifestyle, I'm committed
Sunglasses on at night, I cannot see competition
Yeah, I do like to have fun, but it's always about business
Yeah, you know I'll be on time, be on nine to be specific
Yeah, you know this shit get silly
Made me stronger, didn't kill me
I'll be with you if you're willing
Through the phone, I'm sending kisses
I go all through the night, I'm still ambitious
I can't lie, I do confess to having issues
Man, this viper's really vicious
Man, it struck me through my fingers
Think the poison's gotten in me
Feel it spreading through my system
Man, I'm feeling kind of dizzy
Think I'll fade out in a minute
I can't seem to shake the sickness
Maybe I should get committed
Maybe I could be forgiven
I think grace is to be given
Out to everyone that's willing
To make changes in their living
Man, Drain Gang donny in the Audi like a Saudi
Neon kit under the body
I'm the light inside the party (Shield)
Man, you can't see me, I'm sorry
Prada walking out the lobby
Every time right on the money
Eyes wide open when it's sunny
Man, the stress crashing down, man
The pressure taking over
Couldn't brush this one off my shoulder
I could've sworn that it was over
There's this one place, don't want to go there
I really do not want to go there
Sometimes you need to crush a boulder
Some won't grow up, they just got older
(Varg2 Trademark)

Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today

I don't need to worry 'cause I know the world'll feel this nigga
Blessing in disguise, but I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo

Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[Bridge 1]
Oooh, you'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you (Aaaah)

[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 2]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (We shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart

Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart

There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart

I don't know just where I'm goin'
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushin' on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closin' in on death
You can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

[Verse 3]
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Goin' from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
[Verse 4]
Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
Heh, and that blood is in my head

This is a crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling, and turning around
Wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch

[Verse 2]
Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time
[Verse 3]
Moving along in our God-given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drown by the beach

Destroying the balance I'd kept

Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

[Verse 2]
And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red-rimmed and redlined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

[Verse 4]
Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

[Verse 5]
And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start

Look, I got ten niggas with me, all body catchers
That’s ten straps and Air Max 97s
You know why we legends, ask the streets, yeah
They watched me stretch it, I put the microwave on 90 seconds
The day my brother died like 9/11, I missed him
He smoked a big one when he took that backseat ride to heaven
She see my watch, but I don’t got a second
This wrist got us extras, it’s in the pot doing calisthenics
They talk tough talk, but they don’t want no issues
All they talk is gunplay, but they don’t own no pistols
Sat down at a meeting, manteca on the menu
Red laser on the nickel, turn a hater to a Hindu
If you used to being broke, then this paper gon' offend you
Niggas either dick riding or they paid for their credentials
I was young, the plug told me, ""Just be patient, I’ma hit you
Shit slow, work with me, just take what I can give you""
I took that, doubled back and got greater, I continued
'Cause my loyalty as good as any favor I could lend you
You can hate, but I’m official, I don’t break 'cause I ain't brittle
That’s real G shit, if you a gangster, I commend you, ah

My background official, I don’t back down from issues
I spin back ‘round and get you, pull my mask down and clip you
You can go and check my record, not a blemish on my file
The whole Griselda bought Rolexes and put VSs on the dial
My man calling home sick, said he stressing over trial
I said, “You get a hundred years, you still a legend in the town”
We was youngsters who grew to be crooked, they threw me in booking
This beef shit, speak up, this Uzi’ll cook it
They played hoops, I played the stoop with the tool in the bushes
First day I met your old lady, she threw me the pussy
Yeah, we real niggas, hundred grand, that’s my mother fault
I need another vault, nigga, yeah, that’s hustler talk

She could be a thief but because of that mouth
I give her the benefit of the doubt
Yeah, extra twenty off a brick
Those the benefits of a drought, nigga
I can't even sit on a couch with you
If it's really bricks in the house, nigga
For my city, know how I rock
Breaking news story leaked by the cops
Cuban links on me, too thick to snatch
To run off with mines, I had to get shot
[Chorus]
Rolls Royce truck, they said we stood out
Only one mistake, I ain't have a lookout
Quarter in jewels, shoppin' at Walmart
Take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out

[Verse 2]
Made my whole city wanna be rappers (Yeah)
I made the trappers all shoot for the ceiling
We turned a brick to a lucrative business
My net worth about a cool two million
Already know what you do for them hoes
But it's about what you do for your niggas
Meetings with HOV and kickin' it with E
I put my team in a room with them billions
Fuck all the bloggers, the niggas who shot me
Fuck all the opps and fuck Wendy Williams
Can't trust nobody, it's all smoke and mirrors
I still ain't make no real friends in this business

[Chorus]
Rolls Royce truck, they said we stood out
Only one mistake, I ain't have a lookout
Quarter in jewels, shoppin' at Walmart
Take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out

Back when I was fifteen, it seemed Ugly was untouchable
What, they gonna throw me in the juvie for a month or two?
Try me, I still ain't doin' nothing that you want me to
Cuttin' and disruptin' every classroom discussion
Cussin' out my mom, puffin' blunts, gettin' dusted
Overwhelmed with distrust in everything that I wasn't
Things I know now, I guess I felt 'em back then
Power and control reflect fear among men
The shit that they condemn you can see amongst them
So I never ever ever want to be amongst them
See a landscape littered with the blisters of potential
People letting ghosts govern most of they mental
The opposite adults your folks hoped you'd resemble
Doomed from the get, like a goat in a temple
Hard to not dwell among fear knowing that the court treat crime so severe
But I'm blowin' smoke out the window, being so cavalier
Shake-shakin' up the bottle when I open the beer
Only obligation is to prosper in my operations
Money motivations, stay gaudy, ostentatious
Ain't even a challenge 'cause the rap game basic
I ain't heard talent since—[""Incarcerated Scarfaces"" Sample]
Face it, it's fact, not assumption
Rap sound like shit like, ""ship"" with the fronts in

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya
[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely

Took a look back and he was right before our face

Neptune hate when you switch gears
And I made a hunnid up this year
February comin', I'ma get a mill'
Salty ho said I got secrets
Mash on the breaks, I mean it, uh

Hello, could I speak with Bushwick Bill?
Hello, this is Bushwick motherfucking Bill
Yes, sir, I'm calling to inform you that you have been uh drafted into the United States military
The United States wants me for what? Hahaha
Excuse me, sir?
Hahaha
Bushwick?
Hahaha, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey what's up?
You need to uh contact your nearest recruiting office immediately, please
I see you're not hip to what's happenin'
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
Fuck a war
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this
[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill]
Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
Sendin' a nigga to a desert to get killed
'Cause two suckas can't agree on something
A thousand motherfuckers dying for nothing
You can't pay me to join an army camp
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
Of this United goddamn States of that bitch America
Be a soldier, what for?
They puttin' niggas on the front line
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
While Bush's old ass on TV playin' golf
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'ma shoot your funky ass, bitch
A nigga'll die for a broil
But I ain't fightin' behind no goddamn oil
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Yo, Bush! I ain't your damn ho
The enemy is right here G, them foreigners never did shit me
All of those wasted lives
And only one or two get recognized
But what good is a medal when you're dead?
Tell Uncle Sam I said

[Chorus: Willie D]
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck, fuck, fuck a war)

In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
P.O.W.'s got hung
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
All I know is the couch and my 12 gauge
And what if that pin gets stuck?
Several more casualties show up
This shit remind me of a drive-by
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why?
'Cause they don't know what they doin'
They see if the coast is clear and they start pursuin'
And that's when that booby trap springs, boom!
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
Tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Tryin' to be a damn hero
They bring your folks that duffel bag
The only shit they wanna see is that doggy tag
Hopin' that the worryin' will cease
And your ass will still be in one damn piece
But my mom ain't gotta worry about that there
'Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Man! motherfuck a war!

You're lucky that I ain't the president
'Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over with
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
Flyin' back and forth overseas
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
I'll aim one missile at Iraq
And blow that little piece of shit off the map
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck who dies
'Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in Hell before I enlist
To eat shit out a can like a worm
And everyday wear the same fucking uniform
Sores breakin' on my funky ass feet
Skin crawlin' 'cause I ain't took baths in weeks
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
And if I do, I'll probably be shell-shocked
I couldn't get a job, just a free burial
You know how Uncle Sam treat its veterans
Absolutely no respect
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check
Or a goddamn star, you can have that shit
Motherfuck a war!

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

Step outside to morning air
Lace up my 95's
I see struggle everywhere
Disguised as 9 to 5
Still I'm alive, this life is never fair
All these things that go on in between
Distractions in disguise
Breathe it in, beyond this life of sin there's greener pastures
I'm feeling nasty, but this pack should last me till the afters
My batteries gone, was out last night forgot to charge it
Bill it and pass it
Wray in this flask
Doing my thing regardless

I scratch this silver off this card over and over again
I can't sleep at night but I dream hard
I'm hoping for sevens and tens
Pack of blems, or anything that intoxicates me
On the bus opposite a ten
I don't stand a chance
But her mate rates me
The plug might mates rate me
Guess I should call him later
Been a new school geezer sinking tins of drink and smoking flavours
Nuff of the same old, I need space for a while
What's not done today still happen tomorrow
I smile and break the cycle

Broke my pride at the height of my power

Spot on 116 must've had the cops in they pocket
Hydro jars, fifty a pop, line out the door
This back when we had the nerve to call brickweed chocolate
Stacy said her sister's boyfriend had the new hot shit
Gave me the plug like a stock tip
I found religion, I'm a prophet
Loved that girl, but knew we wouldn't work like Harden on the Rockets
Clouds cleared, I'm looking at the city like jihadis in a cockpit
Prices so fucking high, I had to do 'em dirty just to make a profit
Splits like Spotify numbers
A whole lotta green, just me and the punter
Down for the team, saying all the right things
But feeling like Harden on the Thunder

[Verse 3]
We was raised on it, right?
Light drizzle on the tarmac
Whitey hit Hiroshima, then he doubled back
Black rain baptize black skies
I'm always waiting on a thunderclap
Feed 'em rope till it goes slack
Hot potato, when your quick lick turn to a kidnap
It's easy to take, hard to give back (It's hard to give)
Deep in the Tombs on a humble Pentecostal crumble
In a Sweet and Aromatic
My dude came home like Papillon, his spirit never captured
But truth be told, he never had a second chapter
Camo, green and gold, pull me in the sky, it's the Rapture

Disaster tourists wandering, Chernobyl's wildlife flourish
She said it herself, ""You gotta hold something back""
That's insurance
That sarcophagus crack, the purest radiation flow out my phone jack like a Keurig
A snap of her collarbone, black bra strap, never nothing lurid
For those Cold Wars you need endurance
Dead fish, wild boars swollen with tumors
Snippets of dialogue swimming in her aqueous humor
[Chorus]
The alienation zone is 30 kilometers wide
I'm a sucker, I fall for it every time
My betrothed fled to the forest, hid in thе pines
Still set a place for hеr, unlatched the door so she could come inside

A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again
Solzhenitsyn, she skipped to the end
The cold creepin' in my bones
Wind whip around my home
She came when I'm sleepin', breasts leakin', pussy unkempt
Around her the light bent
Spliff hitting right, light like a opium den
Couldn't quite see her face, it was like the night moved with her whim
I had the piff with a fragile stems
She had some dour from a ""friend"" (Hmm)
Nobody beats the Biz, I mind my business
It's wolves beyond the fences, snares in the snow
Wolves at home in bed, peep the teeth like a dentist
Irredentist Red Army Faction
Around the crib I dug trenches
Mined roads
Interrogated peasants
The mine closed, the shaft open
Who knows where the mind goes
In the morning my pillow smell of pine cones

And have that money back on time to me if I front it, ah (Let's go)
I pull that gun up, you slippin', you better run it
Shells, those feel like oatmeal, they sit in your stomach (Ah)
I came home and let back niggas biddin' them numbers (Free my niggas)
I'm thinkin' 'bout which block that I'm killin' this summer
Ayo, Dior rockin', three fifty-seven to your throat popper (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
He had to lay low, the streets watchin'
Two different color duct tapes, I bet the shit got cut
My shit swimmin', made two to five now we winnin'
Catch me on the yard, creased up, waves spinnin'
C.O. knockin' at my cell, price on the linen
Look, you know the wheels got the big Bs (Uh huh)
The wrist freeze, diamonds dancin' like Chris Breeze (Hahaha)
3500 my sneakers, you can't get these
After I nut, I made the bitch leave (Get out, bitch)
You know my wrist mean (Wrist mean), I double up if the brick clean (Let's go)
But now I get that for a sixteen
Ah, and I spend it like this dope from lotto
SIG throwin' hollows, the bullets big as a Corona bottle (Brr)
It cost twenty bands for a convo
My niggas all capos, last time I cooked up, I wore a poncho (Ah)
Pullin' up on your broad, pronto (What's poppin'?)
I fucked her once, she hit me the next day but the call blocked, though
Ayo, all my jewels on, I'm in the two seater with the roof gone (Skrrt)
Bushmaster with the Raf straps, knock your shoes off (Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot)
Air hole TEC blew off, no screw off
Headshot up close, his Just Don blew off (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
I pull the coupe off with two bitches in my new loft (Vroom)
Diamond tennis chains, VVSs, and a new cross
Bring your biggest gun, nigga, we can have a shoot-off (Ha)
Only hit three niggas, but, shit, I knocked two off (Brr)
We the upper echelon of the hard rappers (Ha)
The most sought-after, bar after bar after bar after
Bar, we raw like soft of the traffic
Nigga got out of pocket and my dawg clapped him (Ah, boom, boom, boom)
We the hardest 'til I'm laid in a coffin (Ah)
I never trade on the squadron
Came with a forklift, ah, we made niggas bosses
Doin' it from the stage to the faucet
They know we the hardest, I hit valet and they parked it, uh (Uh huh)
They want the wave like a dolphin
What gangster is you talkin'? We don't play, we on offense
Stick you and throw your chains in the garbage
They know we the hardest (Let's go), use your brain before they torch it
Lock and load, and aim for the target
My niggas the hardest (Let's go)You might also like2Embed"

I fell in love with diamonds, yeah, my shit two-tone

Or maybe I'm trippin', I'm probably just high
Fuck you and your friend, I'ma let you decide
Tell me what you see in my eyes when you look at me
'Cause when I look up in your eyes I see a reflection of me
And the devil behind me, he lookin' you straight in your eyes
I done fucked up a check a couple times
I done fucked the same bitch a couple times
I done fed all my niggas a couple times
You can try if you want it'd be a large amount
My money is blue and it's green if you colorblind
And don't make me make Dom pull the Cullinan out
I hit her the first time, swear she love me now
She ain't fuck yesterday then she gon' fuck me now

I took some racks out of the bank, I'm finna do what I do
Could you please stop copyin' my flows? Bitch, just do what you do
I'm so fuckin' high, I don't know how to drop the roof

(Marc Boomin, this you?)
I’m sick, she taking to me like that
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I’ma get the money, let you niggas have the hoes
Just dropped a six, in an hour I got a show
I can smell the pussy nigga, it be reeking off they clothes
I’m wearing Off-White, forgot I bought it, I was blown
Seven thousand all dubs, 'bout to spend it on clothes
Off juice every day, I can’t sleep without a pole
Go get you some money, that other shit getting old
Trying to play it like it's sweet, I had shit getting bold
He just got two bricks, he don’t really know a load
Sipping cream sodas, I ain't fucking with Patrón
Her head too good, got me changing up my tone
I sell anything but my motherfucking soul
On the road with some fire, I don’t wanna go home
Back in high school, I was trying to touch in [?]
I got a zip and a Glock in my motherfucking coat
I just put a deuce of Wock' in this little 24
[Verse 2]
I ain’t focused on these hoes, you won’t ever really win
These bitches do whatever for some petty ass revenge
I'ma kick it with my self, everybody acts weird
Bitch I drink lean, not no motherfucking beer
'Bout to put solitaires in my motherfucking ear
Old hoes on my line, heard I'm 'bout to sign a deal
I get her gone for real as soon as he gets a seal
We gon' hold that chopper when shit gets real
Kick it with the clerk, I’m trying to work, let’s cut a deal
The number on the blows 'bout to bang out a zero
Bitch, I hit the set and go to Saks for my apparel
I ain’t into saving hoes, you betrying to be the hero
My dawg off an eight, I'm just hoping he alive
Turned myself into a boss, can't no bitch hurt my pride
Your nigga ain’t a shooter, he can’t make it to Belle Isle
It be looking like a circus when your whole gang aroundYou might also likeEmbed"

Is smiling back on me
Twisting off into the sun
It's okay to be lonely

All my missions float away

She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far
I've got no Houston to whine down to
I've got no protocol
Gravity's so far away
Wrapped on that shrinking ball

I eclipsed my memories
Sleeping inside this pod
Patient time will carry me
On her back without a sigh

And I won't let her down
My soul is celestial-bound
And if I'm never found
She'll always be...

Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat

[Spoken Verse]
I stepped out onto the midway
I was looking for the pirate ship and saw this small, old white tent at one end
It was blue and had white lights hanging all around it
I decided to check out the tent, it seemed I could hear music coming from inside
As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow
I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line
I pulled back the drape thing on the tent
There was a crystal ball at the table, and behind it, a girl wearing a hat
She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read
I said, ""Okay"" and sat down
Then I thought about it for a minute, and asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead
[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Creeping up into the sky
Stopping, at the top, and then starting down
The girl grabbed my hand, I clutched it tight
I said good-bye to the ground

[Verse 2]
Far below, a soiled man
A bucket of torn tickets at his side
He watches the children run by
And cleans his teeth

[Verse 3]
Spinning round, my head began to turn
I shouted, and searched the sky for a friend
I heard the fortune teller, screaming back at me
We stuck out our hands and met the wind

[Verse 4]
The girl falters as she steps down from the platform
She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave
The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready
""Who told you that you could leave?""

The sun was setting by the time we left
We walked across the deserted lot, alone
We were tired, but we managed to smile
At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller
The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face, but I could tell she was blushing18Embed"

Took some real niggas from me, I could kill the whole world and I still won't be even
I be thinkin' 'bout my brothers while I'm shoppin' in Neiman's
Real gangster, when I'm gone, carve my name in the cement
Watch these hoes when you rich, they play games with the semen
Trials and tribulations, I face them
Prosecutors probably wanna case him
See my opps, I jump out and chase them
I ain't Charleston White, nigga, I'll never Mace them
Love for all my artists, nigga, I'll never Mase them
Shit, that's probably why they hate him
Tryna get my brother out of jail, I'm like, ""Hey, Kim""
Cut from a different cloth, he never let it break him
Look at my advance, it make me wonder, would I make them?
But I own my masters, so I can't do shit but thank them
Video visits, he be smilin' on FaceTime
Passionate, I'm talkin' with my hands, these ain't gang signs
You don't know Larry, Tayman, or CJ, you ain't one of mine
Braids on my neck, nigga, I ain't got no hang time
Nigga, I ain't got no kick-it for you
I don't wanna make friends
I don't wanna make amends
I'm chasin' Ms

Big diamonds, Big Puns, VS1's
Long guns, home runs, I'm the don
I can hang in the trenches with no one
Plenty switches with extensions, it's no fun
Givin' out spankings
Ridin' with lil'— 'cause he shoot without thinkin'
Baptize a nigga, send him home in a blanket
Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet
Better not get no throw up on my seat, I know you drinkin'
You ain't fuck no rapper, you a dinosaur, you ancient
I like fried rice, you better cook like you an Asian
Wrote a lot of verses, but I never wrote no statement
I been in them rooms, I never did no contemplatin'
This bitch wanna argue, I ain't doin' no debatin'
Seen her with her nigga, waved my hand, I'm like, ""Hey, friend,""
Lookin' at the Shade Room, that shit be entertainin'
Tryna turn an opp into a motherfuckin' painting

Come up out that booth and bring that energy in person
Got so many hits, it wouldn't be fair to do no verses
I could really go five hours in the stadium
What happened to that nigga claiming OVO? We traded him
Thought I was a popstar, I'm Slaughter Gang, I baited 'em
Walk around like Prince 'cause I got a lot of lady friends
Used to be in 'Sauga out at Sega City Playdium
Skatin' through this album like a Montreal Canadien
Way that I ran shit, you'd think I was Iranian
Niggas see my deal, look at they deal and now they hate the kid
Fuck, let me kick it basic
Niggas ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it
Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit
But if I send a verse to they ass, then they'll take it
Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces
Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages

She wouldn't wear no panties 'round me even if she could
Gave out plenty spankings 'til they got it understood
Fuck the nosebleeds, baby, come sit on this wood
If you know it's tension, don't come 'round me like it's good
I got street smarts and you can't get this out no book
I can't right my wrongs, but I can still write these hooks
Oh, time to get exposed
You ain't been from 'round here, nigga, come get off your show

But that board is opеn, why you actin' like it's closed?

Y'all be goin' in and out rеcessions
The same way that I be goin' in and out of Texas
Or in and out my sessions, or in and out her best friends
Or in and out these courtrooms, my lawyer like, ""Objection""
Yeah, woah, woah

Water on my neck, these diamonds came with coral reefer
She from overseas, I had to buy her a new visa
Met your wife in Vegas, but I hit her in Ibiza
She a supermodel, so she only eatin' Caesar
Used to date a rapper, but he acted like a diva
Niggas hustlin' backwards, out here ballin' with the reup
Popped an Adderall, I feel like I can lift a tree up
Seen too many cameras, so I never lift my ski up (Yeah)

Let me put my window down, I need fresh air
We don't want that, we want bars
The reason why we listen to 21 and The Boy
That's what we do in Paris, we don't do Fashion Week
Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us
It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city
The lights of the Eiffel Tower
I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day
And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly, whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12
I drive a four-cylinder, I come from nothing, but I'm doing something and you cannot catch my drive
As fast as you try to go, you will never catch me, man

Don't worry 'bout my business, I handle it, huh
I take a watch off, it's a Avalanche, huh
I take his ass off, I don't give a damn
He'll get popped if he the middleman
And I'll hit him with some shit, he can't live again
Do that job by myself, fuck that hitman
Best believe in me just like I'm Peter Pan
And I do the dirty work like Dirty Dan
And he talkin' 'bout the partner irrelvant
How you indict a kid with no evidence?
You gon' feel this, you gon' remember this
I'ma break somethin', like a hit stick
My bitch won't go, like a broke whip
Took 'em on that ride, like a field trip
If they play with Glokk, hit the kill switch
You wan' suit up? Nigga, that's yo' due date
You wan' be mob? You better eat that plate
Nigga, fuck a cop, nigga, fuck a jake
I be fuckin' bitches almost everyday
I'ma get some money almost any way
And I hit your bank if you got Chase
And I mix it up, like it's lemonade
Bitch, I'm ten letters, ain't gon' renegade
Got a bad feelin', like a bellyache
I been hearin' rumors, I wanna conversate
When it's time for functions, I was never late
Every bitch I fucked know I got every tape
Me and Sumo posted up at Crystal Lake
This fye hydrate me like it's Gatorade
He got hit with a pistol, need medicate
Go 'head, buddy, get shot in yo' peace state
We ain't worried 'bout 'em, that's for his sake
Glock give me superpowers, fuck that cape
I take all my challenges, I don't do the blame
And they snitch on a young nigga, that's a shame
When she give me brain, that's a no-brain
She a young thot, she got a code name
This ain't hopscotch, I don't playin' no games
Police ask me questions, I ain't did a thing
God sent me this, think I was heaven sent
And a new stick I ain't never met
Bring that chopstick on a private jet
You ain't 'bout shit, you ain't slide yet

To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny

William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
[Verse 2]
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

[Verse 3]
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
See Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $79You might also like[Verse 4]
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face

Time for some action, it was June 1st

On Tonka's and raw, I told her
""Tell it on that, funny with the money 'cause the money ain't yours
We got twenty hostages, I'm ready to die for this!""
Squig said, ""She moving too slow, I'm ready to pop this bitch!""
Then he shot the bitch and we had to move quick
Grab the cash money and foodstamps and jetted towards the whip
Jump started the vehicle, drove a block or two
Looked in the rearview, noticed the boys in blue
Then I bust a u-turn, you could smell the rubber burn
I dusted 'em like a wet bag of sherms (AHHH!)
Went Uptown, slowed down and made a left at the light
Started flowing, unboared, then she lept (STOP! STOP! STOP!)
Up in front of 27th warrant, we ran up in the building
Bid with two duffel bags but at least I had it big (We came off!)
Ran up in the crib, shut the door, the sweat started pouring

Heard it over boom-horn, one officer shouted
I said, ""This is it son, is you 'bout it? See you in Hell!""
Looked my man in the eyes, we started bustin off shells
Goin all out, backin the ATF down, 52 days, they Nicorette style
They got the sharpshooters out, on the project roof
It's 12 o'clock noon, the old lady yelled, ""Don't shoot!""
Then I heard a shot, my heart stopped
Then my man dropped, I fucked with the Glock
(Yo, what the fuck?) And got timed by four cops
They cuffed me up, fucked me up, brought me to the precinct
Ain't feedin me all weekend, all I was doin was thinkin
I blew trial (Damn!) and they threw the book at me and I'm still readin
You could hear the stories over and over in the hood

I'm one man against the world
Just me and my girl — Black Pearl Latina, más fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it
[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat
And, you never see me talk to police
So you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat and I'll leave you right there
So beware — it's rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun — speak, and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets
[Verse 7: Big Pun]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin'
Catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TEC's is in the jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad — ghetto scholars
Full-A-Clips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine every time
Plus, I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it — go and get it
Set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas 'til it's Armageddon
[Chorus: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
Yeah! And you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah! And you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah! And you don't stop!

[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid **** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

Hoes is chilling, biting, smoking, drinking, thinking 'bout my past
Then my homies came thru, and asked, ""Where the hell's the sack?""
Petey handed me a bowl of sour, so I took a couple drags
Then proceeded to go to the back and get hash up out the sack
""Take a little just to make it last""—that's Supa's motto
We fiendin' on these trees like we just won the lotto
Chiefin' for a reason, like we ain't gon' see tomorrow
Until we fall asleep and make some Zs like Zorro
Inhalin' vapors and feeling no sorrow, don't feel no pain
I feel bad for the people who have never kicked it with Mary Jane
She radiates all through my brain and enhances every thought I think
Even makes my food better, and I have more fun when I drink
Gimme a bag of that sticky-icky, I need an eighth for the sixty-sixty
Hippie shit, just like the '60s, except we fresh—them dudes was filthy
Ridin' forty-five in the fifty, I smoked these joints, now I'm spliffy

I just made another stack, I just made another band
My pockets so heavy, I can't hold up my pants
Choppas and pistols and rugers are coming for friends
Pull up in a foreign, and the symbol is a fucking horse
Pull up to the scene, pull up in a motherfuckin' Porsche
Hoes on my dick, cause I think I'm Patrick Star
Niggas want a job cause they know I'm a star
Bullets catch his body, I know he ain't going far (boom)
Pull up to the cut and they know who we are
I need molly in my body, I be totin' on the shotty
In the crib with a thottie, cause she give me sloppy toppy
I do what I wanna I'ma smoke this marijuana
Y'all don't really want no drama but I'm still smoking this Ganja

Stashing crack in my Celine drawers
Niggas got wet, shot up Geraldine's
Mason jars, Maison Margiela scarves

Make his bitch beg please
Then sledgehammer both her knees

I pull up to the car meet smoking on a fifth
If I let you slide then consider that a gift
If I'm fucking with her, let her book a lil trip
I don't remember nun, but I bet I won't forget
If he run up on me, let the old boat rip
They thought I was sketchy, why his hand on his hip?
Stage 2 tuned, hear the pop when I dip
Imma raise a cup for the hood and take a sip
Imma have a fucking blast, crash the event
Imma tell it to the class, he ain't really rich
Piccadilly eating ass niggas talking shit
They was in the club smoking only one skimp
When I get a steak I need a side of grilled shrimp
Or go get the crab leg, butter up the bitch
I ain’t even flex, I won’t butter up the bitch
She wanna pull up just cause of the accent
I don't give a fuck, don’t give me your two cents
Imma give it to a junkie like he needed it

But I'll be gone, before you wake

Do you want something from the convenience
I got a lover disguised as a friend
The problem is your trust the size of a mint
My problem is my heart the size of a man
Baby I see you got used to them lames
Backstreet she got used to them lanes
Backstage she got used to the fame
Backstabbed, got used to the pain

[Verse 2]
You bet not break my heart
I told you all of my insecurities
I told you I can be your security
I told you that middle part would be pretty
Baby don't judge me
I got you jewelry...see?

Now inside of the hood, it got horses
Stop actin' gangsta’, it’s annoyin'
Used to trap that shit out to the mornin'
Call her through when I'm horny
Got her legs lockin' and she moanin'

Tell me why these niggas talkin' tough in they tweets for (Why?)

""Hi-C, what you always mixin' shrooms with the lean for?"" (For?)
Geeked, spilled the drink on my jeans and my sneaks for (Bitch)
""Hi-C, tell me what you fucked that girl of my dreams for"" (What?)
Got her sucking dick on her knees till her knees sore (Yuh)
M's on my brain, give me brain while I brainstorm (Yuh)

Why she let me shuv-it in her guts like a skateboard? (Bitch)

Visions of me hunnid on the dash in a two-door (Nyoom)
If I crash then my brains splashed on the dashboard
In a V12, bitch, it sound like a beast roar (Nyoom)
Let her talk to gang, kick her out like the landlord
Vacuum-sealed packs through the mail, what them beats for? (Yuh)
12 at the front then I'm flash through the backdoor
Stomped his face flat, that's what I'm in the party deep for
Stomp a nigga out, that's what his blood on my sneaks for (Hi-C)
Niggas in my lane but they need to take a detour
Just like Taco Bell, feed 'em shells like a seashore
And I'm still with L, you would think I was in Death Note
Mask on my face, call me Hi-C Mysterio (Haha)
Dick down her throat, kick that bitch out like vamonos
You ain't tryna fuck on the gang, bitch, adios (おかえり)
Underneath a spell, now her face gettin' supersoaked

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You will find that we not very different, no, you and I
Although I usually, usually find a way out
Feelin' like I'm in the skies, my hands could separate clouds
My bitch go get me take-out
They used to hate, they love me, and they used to love, they hate now
The world I rearrange, I turned it to a bloody playground
Here's to the homiеs, stayin' down through anything
A cheers to baby girl, who I would've copped a wedding ring
See, monеy isn't everything, but it helps
We walk around with pride in our eyes to the skies, the lies that we tell
Pickin' up a seashell, listen to the ocean
Do the whole thing all me-self, I'm livin' in the moment
Pickin' up all of the ashes, I'm burnin' the house down
Runnin' for my life, I probably ran a thousand miles now
Had powwows with millionaires, a foul child and a style wild
You found out that I'm killin' there
Tell me how you feelin', how's it feel?
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
How's it feel? (Yeah, said how's it feel?)
How's it feel? (Can you tell me how's it feel?)
How's it feel? (To be around somethin' real)
How's it feel? (Yeah, yeah, said how's it feel?)

How's it feel? So can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel? (To be around something real)
How's it feel?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
They yellin', ""Danger, danger,"" when I hopped out of the manger
With a two-way pager, callin' all the homies, screamin', ""Savior""
This world could not be stranger, you could beat the odd behavior
Give a inch, they take a mile, take a mile, I'll take a acre
I'm a, alien communicator, fuckin' up the human nature
Projectile vomit on a song, the fluid nasty, uh
I just got the iPhone 6, it looks like Steve Jobs done ran out of tricks
Yeah, I come through stuntin' on 'em, in the park, buntin' on 'em
Somebody should pump you up, you best get Joe Budden on 'em
New couch, I'm fuckin' on  it, after that, don't fuckin' want it
Bitch, I'm fuckin' awesome, come again? I said I'm fuckin' awesome
Press the pedal, wah-wah, hell nah, aw, nah
All I want is Lana and some head from Madonna
I gots to separate the weak from the obso-lete
Real life, this is not a dream
I'm a problem, just took a jet from Nicaragua
Copped me a vacation spot that came with an iguana, uh
The hot lava, sonta, a world with no ceilin'

Sorry mama, I cannot show weakness
Niggas walkin' round macho
My thoughts on defense
Paranoia make me talk slow
Freezin' on the walk home
Freezin' when the cops show heaters
Go figure
He gon' talk a lot of beef but he will not-show
I can see it in his eyes
Will weakening to pride
Fear creepin' in his mind
He feel as if he gon' die
And he might not be trippin'
A stack of money and a pistol make em' talk to me different
But my mind set me apart from these niggas
Words connect like apostrophes when I drop 'em on top of these tempos
Slick talk'll get me top at the cribbo
Tight

Science, art and pain
Every field I play in, I demolish
I'ma guard my heart 'til I gain light
Dark days became bright
Part ways, from dark ways and found ways to gain sight
Angel K9, stray nine bullets grazed my hoodie on late nights
I read your eyes, you can't lie to me, you can't hide
Once dollars turn into cents, ain't no guarding my innocence
I'ma walk with my syndicates, I'm the heart of it (started it)

He already back to selling crack
He look at me and said ""this all that he know""
Rocking Sasquatchfabrix from head to toe
The cloth we was cut from it's still loyalty
Twelve gold slugs, Chanel mask you know it's me

Fly as a pelican, benevolent
Drug money infectious, we whipping up extras
My man got killed for two pounds of [""MID""]
My kicks cost that, it hurt for me to see his kids
I'm from a city where everybody got ten bodies
Burberry trench covering the chopped shottie
Niggas had buck shots in every part of 'em
Yeah they might be fly now but I fathered them
Call for neighbor dealers carving bricks
Low top Margiela's looking marvelous
Style was crystal foul, fountains of ace
Leave 'em shot floating in it like Scarface (brrrrrrrrt)
You broke my heart when you killed Frank
(Remember when Tony shot Pussy on the boats yo?)
You broke my heart when you killed Frank
(Seemed like yesterday I was running guns)
Ayo, Sly still got four lives left
Full length Mink to the Nike check
Ricardo, lemon squeeze, fifty shot TEC
Shot fourty five hanging out the Murciélago
Praying for tomorrow

Where you get rich, die trying and face murder

See me at your college campus, baggie full of Adderalls
Call me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boost
See them other chickenheads? They don't never leave the coop
I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates
Serving all the fiends over there by the Golden Gate

Why you looking bitter? I be looking better

Auntie mad 'cause I stank up thе house
I'm trappin' in bales, in the house [?]
I'm pushin' P's with a K
Glock with a dick gon' fuck up your day
My shooter Febreze, he see you and spray
I'm with a stripper named Cinnamon
Eyes on a milli', I'm in the house militant
I got a grinch in the house, no Eggs Benedict
I'm good with the plug, I don't care what the ticket is
I'm up in New York with the grabba
I spit game and his ho gon' swallow
I'm livin' life like it ain't no tomorrow
I walk 'round [?], I hit the lotto
Ice on my neck and I'm smokin' Gelato
My bitch is freaky, she thick
Tats on her body, she talk with an attitude
I swear to God, she think she Mulatto
I finger-fuck money, I make her Flo Milli
I like all kinds, but my ho picky
I swear I'll try right now, don't tempt me
[Chorus]
I gotta roll one so I can ease my pain
I'm pourin' fours, I'm fantastic
I'm Johnny Blaze when I slide with that thing
I got a bad bitch worried, she can't wait until I get home
I hop out the field and then get in her dome
I get back in that field and then get on the road
I gotta roll one so I can ease my pain
I'm pourin' fours, I'm fantastic
I'm Johnny Blaze when I slide with that thing

Niggas like to talk, I swear I never bе hearin' a sound
I'm so high, I swear I’d hate if I camе down
Glock hold 50 shots, we knock his brains out
Mini-chopper and it hit 'em with a takedown
Demons in my head, don't have time to play around
[Chorus]
At the top, and no, I'm never goin' down
I'm with my demons, they like killers on the prowl
Voices in my head, I'm tryna get 'em the fuck out
I got so much money on me if you need it'll run down
It feel like I haven't seen you in awhile
We pushin' for freedom, we get it, we runnin' wild
Fuck around, I'm probably tearin' my hair out

Donald Green was a man who had already been convicted of murder and was spending what should've been the rest of his life in the Attica prison. And then he was later shifted to a downstate prison facility, which was even more secure, known as Shawangunk and even though he was in this prison facility he was continuing to run a drug organization using the prison telephones

When I was broke, I ain't like how I felt

Rich slime, now I'm gettin' to the wealth
I was broke as fuck, I ain't like how I felt
I was fucked up but I didn't ask for help
Feel way better when you get it by yourself
I played the cards that a nigga was dealt
Glock 9 and it's tucked in my belt
Gotta stay strapped even though I'm out on bail
My face card stamped, I stay with clientele
Yeah, I got the pack through the mail
Had to double the seal just to hide the smell
Gotta move smart 'cause I can't take a L
Man 12 hot as fuck but I still rebelle
I be in Riverdale posted up at the Shell
Undercovers tryna get me like Denzel
In the trap always tryna make a sale
24 hours, I spent the night in a hotel

[Verse 3: K$upreme]
Still catchin' them plays like Odell
You say you get money, I can't tell
I might go trap out the hotel
I done sold more gas than a pump at Shell
Stackin' the bands now I make my pockets swell
Shark gang nigga, we the black cartel
I got these Off White fives on, I'm fresh as hell
Tryna vacuum seal the Shark, still couldn't hide the smell
My face card good, I got rich clientele
I gotta thank God I'm winnin', I been through some Ls
Seen my big bro make a few mills off of scams
Four of Wock' now I move like a snail

Three hoes in da' hotel
That's a trio
Stiffy for the hoes, puta no me importa, no
Puta yo, tengo swag, tu novio se quiere matar
Porque el no tiene estilo, y yo tengo swag de mas, yeah

[Estribillo]
Largense todos, voy a causar un BigBang
Me siento en el Battlefield, causo una guerra mundial
Esa bitch quiere estar conmigo y a mi me da igual
Como El Doctor tengo una rubia del Ku Klux Klan

See, I won't purchase her no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, Kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence
There he go, he cast broads like radios
Shit, your lady knows, it's Young T like baby clothes

Blah, blah, blah, blah 'bout trauma
You ain't special, everybody got problems, uh
Sorry I'm not empathetic (Nah, I'm fuckin')
Sorry you think I'm pathetic
Sorry I don't wanna bro down
Sorry I don't know your pronouns
I don't mean no disrespect
But, damn, we just met, calm the fuck down
Oh, I'm out of touch and I'm a jerk?
A bank account could never match my worth (That nigga gettin' money, he a dick now)
Sorry, Mother Earth
Polluted air with chemicals and dirt
These cars ain't gonna buy and drive themselves
What the hell you think I work for?
Not to not explore and stay the same (I'm)
Sorry to the fans who say I changed, 'cause I did
Sorry you don't know me on a personal level to pinpoint what it is
I'm sorry to my ancestors (I'm so sorry), I know I'm supposed to fight (I know)
But this ice shinin' brighter than a black man's plight, I'ma make it right
In the meantime, I'll give some advice while these blood diamonds gettin' cleaned off
Nigga, fuck the price, spend it then, then again, I can't save niggas
I'm not Superman, but I could try
I'm sorry I'm pretentious
Sorry that the talent, knowledge, passion isn't missin'
Sorry when I talk my shit and I could back it up with confidence, it get you niggas trippin', man
Fuck the numbers, fuck a hook
You put me on a stage and I'll show you the difference
Let me see y'all hit a stage (No, y'all can't do it)
Let me see y'all write a page (Y'all not gon' do it)
Let me see you make a decision I made
And claim that I don't know about minimum wage or Section 8
Water in the ketchup bottle to stretch when niggas ate
Gettin' pressed by niggas hoppin' gates
Thinkin' it's normal 'cause you ain't supposed to make it past eighteen or escape the Figure 8 cycle
And I promise this is like a diet, I'ma make a way and I did, did
Feel good, work paid off, now we gon' celebrate
But niggas claim you arrogant when they can't relate to moments of feelin' great
So they aim, duck-duck-duck 'em
Shot right back, buck-buck-buck 'em
Sorry, not sorry (Buck 'em, buck 'em)
I got two words, fuck 'em

Show you how to stunt (Hahaha), show you how to stunt
Show you how to stunt (We tried to tell y'all niggas), show you niggas how to stunt on 'em
Show you how to stunt (Hahaha), show you how to stunt
What, you didn't believe us?

[Verse 1: Vince Staples & DJ Drama]
Got slave whip money, can't choose which one
Might go chip somethin', can't choose which gun
Don't do no cuffin', go when night come
No, you can't be my girl, bitch, are you dumb? (Are you dumb?)
Never gave a fuck about where a nigga from
Chopper in the trunk with a hundred in the drum
Mob a nigga up, then I'm headed to Milan
Gotta catch a flight to catch me slippin', you're a bum
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Vince Staples]
Run it up, run it up, no, them niggas not with us (Niggas not with me)
She got freckles, I got cookies, tell them bitches, ""Come with us""
Got that house on the hilly, lean like a double cup
Clean like my stubble cut (Nah)

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I will never give a fuck, got the blower in the bluff
PV servin' tennis like a motherfuckin' cluck
If you ridin', buckle up (Duh), niggas dyin' if I'm touched
Big Gs, big Cs, if you cousin, throw it up
Niggas marked out (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, pipe down, I don't fight hoes

Bitch, I got a jelly bean, kelly green Rolls
And the guts off-white like a jalapeño
Leather hot in here, shit make Nelly sing songs
Big pearls on the belt make my belly seem swole
I'm watchin' Queen Gambit, lookin' like an extra
Different color chess pieces hangin' from my necklace (Bleh)
Stones too heavy, give me red neck, Texas
I cover it with scarves in the closet like my exes
Fiat 151, bitch, this ain't a Lexus
Third gear got me drivin' like I got a death wish
Small Italian town, hittin' wheelies on a Vespa
Stamps on my passport is longer than a lecture (Y'all ready?)
Handshake from God and some explainable etceteras
Is what the fuck you gon' need if you tryna catch up

Long live $cams

I ain't Irish, but my money doubling, grab a shamrock
I ain't trickin' with you bitches, pockets came with padlocks
They thought that I was fantasizing, showed 'em that I can pop
Grew my hair down to my shoulders, fan thought I was Matt Ox
Jump a fence and get my lick back like this The Sandlot
Tell them boys to quit the lying, living life on caps lock

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Florida to the Mitten, SBDSM X BLP
You a burger with some ham minus cheese, you a BLT
Tables, ladders, chairs, it get extreme, we creep like TLC
You gon' catch some legal bullets, boy, I got a CLP
Oops, I mean CPL, my driver got a CDL
Why this bitch be preachin' like she real, but got a BBL?
If I ever fell off, it was on a trampoline
How I walk out with it on, you would've thought it’s fashion week
Off Runtz, defying gravity, the Wraith look like a galaxy
My shooter throw his hoodie on and score, Carmelo Anthony
Was in school, I had that bag on me with more pape’ than the faculty
Boy, you grown without a strategy, that's really just a tragedy
Rolled a seven in the Jungo leaf, that’s max capacity
They left me in the jungle in the rain, ain't have a canopy
Jugg Messiah, I'm your majesty or that shit blasphemy
And free the legend 80s, I can't lie, look up ""Veracity""

They thought I was a con, made it out the sewer, I'm a connoisseur
Me and BabyTron just hit the city, feel like Zeke and Luther
Touch down with the Dog Shit Militia, smoking cow manure
Opp kebab, I introduce the stick and put them on a skewer
Mentioning my damn dog, they won't make it far
Find 'em all and fuck 'em over like a bad A&R
Make 'em jump, Van Halen, we could rock out, no guitar
Let that iron duel like the Renaissance, who tryna spar?

When I'm this rare

They all want my fallen stars, but I be outer space
We be going super far, ion want y'all in my face
I put too much in this car, I hit 3 times then I'm faded
I get high like astronauts, I don't play with y'all robots
I be praying to Allah, he say y'all boys some rare angels
I don't feel like none of y'all
I'm swaggin' on the astral plane
? with this mac-11 cook like microwave
I'm a dark angel art angels flying like a raven
I don't let them have my heart cuz' they can't save me no
I do what I want I'm Jupitеr lil' baby bro
I'm the space cowboy I walk in with the lasеr pole
If she let me touch her soul I bet I take her soul
She say ""Kai, why you never call my phone?""
I be on Venus ima kill it when I come home

I like how these diamonds shine when it's a full moon
